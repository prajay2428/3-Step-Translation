  <!-- Prompts (Hidden) -->
  <script type="text/plain" id="prompt_initial">I am attaching the audio of a sadhguru discourse to the audience.
    I want you to first transcribe the same and then translate it to telugu as per the below guidelines.
    
    
    Understanding Sadhguru’s delivery style::
    
    How Sadhguru Delivers His Speech (Structurally)
     A. Thought-by-thought delivery (NOT sentence-by-sentence)
    Sadhguru does not speak in grammatically complete sentences.
    He speaks in:
    thought units
    idea chunks
    pause-driven fragments
    Example (English original style):
    “Life is not a problem to be solved…
    it is a reality to be experienced.”
    This is two thoughts, not one sentence.
     Translation rule:
     Translate by thought, not by grammar.
    
     B. Pause is part of meaning
    Sadhguru uses silence as punctuation.
    He often pauses:
    before the punchline
    after a deep question
    before contradiction (“No…”)
     Translation rule:
     Preserve pause points even if grammar feels “broken”.
    
     C. Question → Silence → Answer pattern
    He frequently does:
    Ask a simple question
    Pause
    Turn the question upside down
    Example:
    “Do you want peace?
    Or do you want to control everything?”
     Translation rule:
     Keep questions short and spoken, not literary.
    
    
    
    Understanding the intention of the speaker:
    Essentially Sadhguru is from India. So the english sentence construction he uses sometimes actually follows the south indian language syntax. So when I translate from English back to telugu, you have to actually take into account the influence of this native language structure into account and then identify the intention he wanted to convey - rather than just going by english syntax rules, and giving the telugu translation as per literal english syntax format.
    
    
    Your task is to translate/finetune the translation of Sadhguru’s English discourse into natural, spoken Telugu
    
    
    optimized for voice dubbing and AI voice cloning.
    
    
    Do NOT translate/tune word-by-word.
    Translate/tune thought-by-thought.
    
    
    Follow these rules strictly:
    • Short spoken lines
    • Conversational Telugu
    • Preserve pauses and rhythm
    • Use ellipses (…) for silence
    • Keep questions simple and direct
    • Avoid bookish or Sanskrit-heavy Telugu
    • Avoid long compound sentences
    • Maintain calm authority, not preaching
    • Humor should be recreated, not literally translated
    • Spiritual insight should feel experiential, not academic
    
    
    Output must sound like Sadhguru speaking Telugu naturally.
    
    While Quoting the sentences spoken by people, use the natural spoken telugu style.
    
    English:
     She said, "I hear that monks are looking for shelter in many homes; why don't you come and stay in my house?"
    
    Telugu:
    ఆమె అంది, "సన్యాసులు చాలా ఇళ్ళలో ఆశ్రయం కోసం చూస్తున్నారని విన్నాను; నువ్వెందుకు నా ఇంట్లో ఉండకూడదు?". 
    
    Optimized:
    ఆమె, "సన్యాసులు చాలా ఇళ్ళలో ఆశ్రయం కోసం చూస్తున్నారని విన్నాను; నువ్వు  <T2>వచ్చి నా ఇంట్లో ఉండొచ్చు కదా?" అంది. 
    
    అంది, అన్నాడు, అని అడిగాడు. అని చెప్పాడు - all these words should come at the end of the quote sentence as per common telugu usage.
    4. Do not keep the filler words as it is. Use the contextual connecting word based on the flow.
    Ex:
    సో - కాబట్టి, అంటే, అందువల్ల, అందుకని 
    ఓకే? - సరేనా? అర్థమైందా?  
    యు నో - తెలుసా 
    
    
    5. Paragraph Splitting
    Break paragraphs: 
    for each cause → effect shift 
    at every example or story detail 
    when a new point begins (tone shift) 
    when a question occurs 
    when speaker changes (if applicable)
    So that this will hint the dubbing artist where the tone needs to the shifted accordingly.
    
    
    6. Preserve segmented and paused style to match the lip sync and silence pattern.
    
       The talk is made up of blocks of points.
        Each point is made up of blocks of thoughts.
        Each thought is made up of blocks of information.
        
        We have used … , ; - . and ? to mark the boundaries of Information blocks, thoughts and ideas - to hint the dubbing artist for proper modulation.
    
    … indicates a pause in between the sentences.
    , indicates a pause between meaningful chunks that make up the sentence.
    ; indicates connected sentences.
    Hiphen (-) indicates additional information related to the main idea of the sentence.
    
    8. Duration & Lip-Sync Matching (Crucial)
    Match the Length: The Telugu translation must take approximately the same amount of time to speak as the English original. Do not condense long English sentences into short Telugu summaries.
    Keep the "Fluff": If the speaker uses filler phrases (e.g., "The nature of the thing is...", "What I am saying is...", "You know..."), translate them into natural Telugu conversational fillers (e.g., "దీని స్వభావం ఎలా ఉంటుందంటే...", "నేను చెప్పేది ఏంటంటే...", "మీకు తెలుసా...") instead of skipping them.
    Respect Repetition: If the speaker repeats a word for emphasis (e.g., "Georgia... not that Georgia, the Georgia Georgia"), reflect that repetition in Telugu to fill the time gap.
    Expand, Don't Contract: When in doubt, use a slightly longer phrase to ensure there is no "dead air" (silence) while the speaker's lips are moving.
    
    
    9. Note that the goal is to translate his discourse to telugu, not to improve on his thoughts. As these are the master’s words, please don't summarize or simplify the transcript, or add on to or change what he has actually said.
        Do not remove or add any words or letters.
        Do not remove anything, even if it is redundant or repetition
    
    Example of ‘thought to thought English Transcription’:
    
    (see how: 
    The blocks of thoughts are made, 
    Each line carries one complete sense-unit within a thought; line splitting is not based on grammar or sentence rules. But based on how meaning moves through speech.
    Multiple sense-units may appear on the same line when they function as part of a single continuous reasoning flow and do not form independent landing points; when they belong to one uninterrupted cognitive sweep that has not yet reached a landing point.
    if the sense unit is not the ending of the thought, then … is used , if it is the ending of the thought, then . (or other relevant punctuation) is used
    Pauses within a line are preserved by placing …)
    
    
    The forces working upon... life upon this planet varies…
    from one latitude to another.
    
    Because of a certain shape and a form it takes... 
    it could become differently competent.
    It is because of this... 
    that... uh... you know... 
    being in contact... with the earth is a very important part of one's health and well being.
    
    
    I know... 
    the medical community would... make fun of this. 
    But I 100% stand by this.
    
    The question is uh... 
    being in a certain part of the planet... 
    does the celestial geometry work upon you in a particular way?
    The nature of the larger human system... or the deeper human system... 
    how it functions…
    definitely is impacted... by the location.
    It makes them different.
    
    As you know... 
    with... it is true with every other life.
    The plant life and the animal life... which is very comfortable in Southern India... 
    would uh... will... would wither away... 
    in uh... anywhere around... uh... New York state... or in that part of the world.
    Because... the life... here has evolved... 
    It's not just the weather.
    It's not just the weather... and the volume of sunlight... or cold... that happens.
    Yes... those are... a big impact too.
    But why life has evolved... the way it has evolved... 
    has something to do with the location.
    
    It is a fact... 
    anthropologically recognized fact…
     that a certain race of people... 
    when they migrated from one... geographic... location... to an entirely different geographic location...
    many racial features in their physiology... will slowly change... 
    and over a period of time… there is a distinct change... 
    to a point where you could not recognize how they were... at a certain time.
    
    For example... 
    India has been a cauldron of racial mix... for a long time.
    But you will see how... being at this location on the planet...
    of course the temperatures... the weather... all these things have an influence... 
    but apart from that...
    just the nature of the food that they eat... nature of... how the... what planetary position they are... 
    how it has altered their physical features...and how they've completely changed is quite unbelievable.
    It is Central Asian people... 
    who came down... as the Aryans about 8,000 years ago.
    
    Just see how people in Georgia…
    I'm not talking about uh... United States Georgia... 
    I'm talking about the Georgia Georgia... okay?
    In Central Asia... 
    how those people look 
    and how people who have come from there... who lived in India for over 6 to 8,000 years... 
    how they look...
    you will be amazed how they have changed.
    Everything about them has changed.
    
    So there is weather... there is food... there is latitude... which makes the difference.
    Because... the speed... at which the planet is spinning... has different effect... of centrifugal and centripetal forces working upon every object... upon the planet.
    The forces working upon... life upon this planet varies from one latitude to another.
    So based on this... 
    the impact upon how the body shapes itself... 
    and because of that... because of a certain shape and a form it takes…
    it could become differently competent.
    
    It's unfortunate that every difference... 
    certain human beings turn it into a discriminatory process.
    Otherwise... 
    if you study the differences... that the planet has produced... 
    different types of life forms that it has produced... 
    even different types of human beings that the planet has produced...
    it's amazing and incredible... 
    and there is a whole lot of things to know about this.
    
    And uh... India's... latitude and longitude... largely... makes them... inward focused... than outward.
    This does not mean others cannot do this.
    Everybody can do this.
    There is also a cultural evolution that happens over a period of time... 
    there are many factors.
    But definitely... being in different parts of the world... 
    the body becomes competent.
    
    It's not like... if you move from one place to another now in next two years time everything about you will change - 
    need not... 
    unless you're willing to change.
    You could resist that... 
    but changes will happen in spite of your resistance... 
    even in your own lifetime…
     just because geographically... you're located in a completely different space.
    
    It's very difficult to gauge this 
    because the amount of cultural influence... and other social influences are so big... and so intertwined…
    that you cannot really separate this.
    But suppose we had looked at a world... before the migration started... before we started traveling as we are traveling today...
    you can clearly see the distinction as to how planet generated a certain type of life... in a certain part of the world.
    This is true with every other life... 
    and definitely with a human being too.
    
    You also... I think interjected with a question about the food.
    I must tell you this.
    In yoga... 
    the prescription for eating the food is... 
    how much distance a man can walk in a day... 
    In a single day how much distance you can walk…
     that should be the radius... of the area from which you must eat.
    You should not eat food which is grown far away from you 
    because... the body that you carry... is essentially... a piece of this planet.
    If it is a piece of this planet…
    if you're eating food from that specific area... and you're living on that area...
    there is a constant interaction between your body...
    
    Don't think this happens only after... you find your cemetery spot.
    Even today... as you are sitting here... 
    if you sit in this place...
    your body and the earth of this... this part of the earth on which you're sitting... 
    is in a constant state of a very profound interaction.
    It is because of this... that... uh... you know... being in contact... with the earth is a very important part of one's health and well being.
    
    In... in the yoga center... 
    we are always giving people to work in the garden if they're not healthy... 
    so that they're in touch with the earth.
    This being in touch with the earth... 
    today in modern spas has reduced itself to a mud bath.
    Well... you must be in touch... somehow.
    It doesn't matter how you do it... 
    either with a mud bath or by working in the land... whichever way... 
    or sleeping on the floor... or whatever you do essentially you're trying to be in contact.
    
    And food is a transaction.
    What was in the earth... 
    you're taking it into the body.
    It will function best... if it comes from that piece or that area of earth on which you're living.
    So generally the prescription is like this... 
    how much you can walk in a day... 
    that should be the radius... of land from which you eat.
    
    That is... 
    if you are growing food on your own farm and eating... 
    you will see within a month's time...
    suppose you live on a patch of land... grow your own food and eat... within a month's time...
    you will see a distinct... a very distinct change in the healthfulness of your body.
    I would say... 
    if this one thing... this one simple thing is done... 
    I think... we can bring down the incidence of cancer on this planet... by 50 to 60%.
    I would stand by this.
    
    I know... 
    the medical community would uh... make fun of this.
    But I 100% stand by this...
    At least 50% of the incidence of cancer could be brought down... 
    if we are in touch with the earth that we are living upon... and the food comes from the area in which you live... 
    not from somewhere else.
    
    Right now... 
    if I go for breakfast in this hotel... 
    probably the fruit comes from New Zealand.
    They told me the fish comes from Vietnam.
    And I don't know what else come from where.
    So... just because we are able to transport things around... 
    and there are supermarkets which can sell the world to you... 
    we're doing this...
    more for pleasure... not for well being.

    ఈ గ్రహం మీద... జీవంపై పనిచేసే శక్తులు... 
    ఒక అక్షాంశం (Latitude) నుండి... మరొక అక్షాంశానికి మారుతూ ఉంటాయి.
    
    అది తీసుకునే ఒక నిర్దిష్టమైన ఆకారాన్ని బట్టి... దాని రూపాన్ని బట్టి... అది వేరు వేరు రకాలుగా సమర్థవంతం కాగలదు.
    దీనికి కారణం ఏంటంటే... 
    ఉమ్... మీకు తెలుసా... 
    మనం భూమితో ఒక స్పర్శలో ఉండటం అనేది... మనిషి యొక్క ఆరోగ్యానికి... అలాగే శ్రేయస్సుకి... చాలా అంటే చాలా ముఖ్యం.
    
    నాకు తెలుసు... 
    వైద్య ప్రపంచం దీన్ని చూసి... ఎగతాళి చేయొచ్చు. 
    కానీ నేను దీనికి నూటికి నూరు శాతం కట్టుబడి ఉన్నాను.
    
    ప్రశ్న ఏంటంటే... 
    గ్రహం మీద ఒక నిర్దిష్ట ప్రదేశంలో ఉన్నప్పుడు... 
    ఖగోళ అమరిక (Celestial geometry) మీపై ఒక ప్రత్యేక పద్ధతిలో పనిచేస్తుందా?
    
    ఈ విస్తృతమైన మానవ వ్యవస్థ స్వభావం... లేదా... ఇంకా లోతైన మానవ వ్యవస్థ అనుకోండి... 
    అది పనిచేసే విధానం... 
    కచ్చితంగా... మనం ఉండే ప్రదేశం వల్ల ప్రభావితమవుతుంది.
    అది వాళ్ళని విభిన్నంగా ఉండేలా చేస్తుంది.
    
    మీకు తెలుసు... 
    మిగతా ఏ ఇతర జీవానికీ చూసినా... ఇది నిజం.
    దక్షిణ భారతదేశంలో ఎంతో హాయిగా ఉండే వృక్షజాలం గానీ... జంతుజాలం గానీ…
    అవి... అవి వాడిపోతాయి…
     ఎక్కడంటే... ఆ... న్యూయార్క్ రాష్ట్రం చుట్టుపక్కల... లేదా ప్రపంచంలోని ఆ భాగంలో ఎక్కడైనా సరే.
    
    ఎందుకంటే... ఇక్కడి జీవం... పరిణామం చెందింది... 
    ఇది కేవలం వాతావరణం వల్ల మాత్రమే కాదు.
    కేవలం వాతావరణం... ఇంకా సూర్యకాంతి పరిమాణం... లేదా చలి... ఇవి మాత్రమే కాదు అక్కడ జరిగేది.
    అవును... వాటి ప్రభావం కూడా ఎక్కువే అనుకోండి.
    కానీ జీవం ఎందుకు ఆ రీతిలో పరిణామం చెందింది... అన్నదానికి... 
    కచ్చితంగా ఆ ప్రదేశంతో సంబంధం ఉంది.
    
    ఇదొక వాస్తవం... 
    ఆంత్రోపాలజీ (Anthropology) పరంగా... అందరూ గుర్తించిన వాస్తవం…
    ఒక నిర్దిష్ట జాతి ప్రజలు... 
    వాళ్ళు ఒక... భౌగోళిక... ప్రదేశం నుండి... పూర్తిగా భిన్నమైన మరో భౌగోళిక ప్రదేశానికి వలస వెళ్ళినప్పుడు...
    వాళ్ళ శరీర తత్వంలోని అనేక జాతి లక్షణాలు... మెల్లమెల్లగా మారుతూ వస్తాయి...
    ఇంకా కాలక్రమేణా... ఒక స్పష్టమైన మార్పు వస్తుంది... 
    ఎంతగా అంటే - ఒకానొక సమయంలో వాళ్లు ఎలా ఉండేవారో కూడా మీరు గుర్తుపట్టలేనంతగా!
    
    ఉదాహరణకు... 
    భారతదేశం ఎప్పటినుండో... అనేక జాతుల మిశ్రమానికి ఒక కూడలిగా ఉంది.
    కానీ మీరు గమనిస్తే... ఈ గ్రహం మీద ఈ ప్రదేశంలో ఉండటం వల్ల…
    వాస్తవానికి ఉష్ణోగ్రతలు... వాతావరణం... ఇవన్నీ ప్రభావం చూపిస్తాయి...
    కానీ అది కాకుండా...
    కేవలం వాళ్ళు తినే ఆహార స్వభావం... వాళ్ళ... గ్రహ స్థానం ఏంటి... 
    అది వారి శారీరక లక్షణాలను ఎలా మార్చేశాయంటే... ఇంకా వాళ్ళు పూర్తిగా ఎలా మారిపోయారంటే... అది నిజంగా నమ్మశక్యం కానిది.
    మధ్య ఆసియా ప్రజలే... 
    సుమారు 8,000 ఏళ్ల క్రితం ఆర్యులుగా ఇక్కడికి దిగివచ్చారు.
    
    
    జార్జియాలోని ప్రజలు ఎలా కనిపిస్తారో చూడండి...
    నేను మాట్లాడుతున్నది... అమెరికాలోని జార్జియా గురించి కాదు...
    నేను చెప్తున్నది అసలు సిసలు జార్జియా గురించి... సరేనా?
    మధ్య ఆసియాలో... 
    ఆ ప్రజలు ఎలా కనిపిస్తారో... 
    ఇంకా అక్కడి నుండి వచ్చిన ప్రజలు... ఎవరైతే భారతదేశంలో 6 నుండి 8,000 ఏళ్లుగా నివసిస్తున్నారో... 
    వాళ్ళు ఎలా ఉన్నారో చూస్తే...
    వాళ్ళు ఎంతగా మారిపోయారో చూసి మీరే ఆశ్చర్యపోతారు.
    వాళ్ళ గురించిన ప్రతీదీ మారిపోయింది.
    
    కాబట్టి వాతావరణం ఉంది... ఆహారం ఉంది... అక్షాంశం ఉంది... ఇవన్నీ తేడాని కలిగిస్తాయి.
    ఎందుకంటే... గ్రహం తిరిగే వేగం... ప్రతీ వస్తువుపై పనిచేసే... అపకేంద్ర, అభికేంద్ర శక్తులపై (Centrifugal, Centripetal forces)... వేర్వేరు ప్రభావాల్ని చూపుతుంది.
    ఈ గ్రహం మీద జీవంపై పనిచేసే శక్తులు... ఒక అక్షాంశం నుండి మరొక అక్షాంశానికి మారుతూ ఉంటాయి.
    కాబట్టి దీని ఆధారంగా... 
    శరీరం తనను తాను మలుచుకునే విధానంపై ప్రభావం ఉంటుంది…
    ఇంకా దానివల్ల... అది తీసుకునే ఒక నిర్దిష్ట ఆకారం, రూపాన్ని బట్టి… అది విభిన్న రకాలుగా సమర్థవంతం కాగలదు.
    
    దురదృష్టం ఏంటంటే... ప్రతీ వ్యత్యాసాన్ని… 
    కొంతమంది మనుషులు ఒక వివక్షాపూరిత ప్రక్రియగా మార్చేస్తున్నారు.
    లేకపోతే... 
    ఈ గ్రహం సృష్టించిన వైవిధ్యాలను గనక మీరు అధ్యయనం చేస్తే… అది ఉత్పత్తి చేసిన వివిధ రకాల జీవరూపాలు... ఆఖరికి ఈ గ్రహం ఉత్పత్తి చేసిన విభిన్న రకాల మనుషులని చూసినా...
    ఇదంతా అద్భుతం... నమ్మశక్యం కానిది.
    దీని గురించి తెలుసుకోవాల్సిన విషయాలు చాలా చాలా ఉన్నాయి.
    
    ఇంకా ... భారతదేశం యొక్క... అక్షాంశం, రేఖాంశం... స్థూలంగా... ఇక్కడి వారిని... బయట కన్నా అంతర్ముఖులుగా చేస్తుంది.
    దీనర్థం ఇతరులు ఇది చేయలేరని కాదు.
    ప్రతీ ఒక్కరూ ఇది చేయగలరు.
    కాలక్రమేణా జరిగే ఒక సాంస్కృతిక పరిణామం కూడా ఉంటుంది... ఇంకా చాలా అంశాలు ఉన్నాయి.
    కానీ కచ్చితంగా... ప్రపంచంలోని వివిధ ప్రాంతాల్లో ఉండటం వల్ల... శరీరం దానికి తగ్గట్టుగా తయారవుతుంది.
    
    
    
    అలాగని... మీరేదో ఇప్పుడు ఒక చోట నుండి మరో చోటకి వెళితే... వచ్చే రెండేళ్లలో మీ గురించిన ప్రతీదీ మారిపోతుందని కాదు - 
    అవసరం లేదు... 
    ఒకవేళ మీరు మారడానికి సిద్ధంగా ఉంటే తప్ప.
    మీరు దాన్ని ప్రతిఘటించవచ్చు... 
    కానీ మీ ప్రతిఘటన ఉన్నప్పటికీ మార్పులు జరిగి తీరుతాయి... 
    మీ జీవితకాలంలోనే...
    ఎందుకంటే భౌగోళికంగా... మీరు పూర్తిగా భిన్నమైన ప్రదేశంలో స్థిరపడ్డారు కాబట్టి.
    
    దీన్ని అంచనా వేయడం చాలా కష్టం... 
    ఎందుకంటే సాంస్కృతిక ప్రభావం... ఇంకా ఇతర సామాజిక ప్రభావాలు చాలా పెద్దవి... ఇంకా అవి ఎంతలా పెనవేసుకుపోయాయంటే... 
    మీరు దీన్ని నిజంగా విడదీసి చూడలేరు.
    కానీ ఒకవేళ మనం ఒక ప్రపంచాన్ని చూసి ఉంటే... ఈ వలసలు ప్రారంభం కాకముందు... మనం ఈ రోజు ప్రయాణిస్తున్నట్లుగా ప్రయాణించడం ప్రారంభించకముందు...
    ఈ గ్రహం... ప్రపంచంలోని ఒక నిర్దిష్ట భాగంలో... ఒక ప్రత్యేకమైన జీవాన్ని ఎలా సృష్టించిందో మనం స్పష్టంగా చూడవచ్చు.
    
    ప్రతీ ఇతర జీవానికీ ఇది వర్తిస్తుంది... 
    ఇంకా కచ్చితంగా మానవునికి కూడా.
    
    
    మీరు... మధ్యలో ఆహారం గురించి కూడా ఒక ప్రశ్న అడిగారు అనుకుంటాను.
    నేను మీకు ఇది చెప్పాలి.
    యోగలో... ఆహారం తినడానికి ఉన్న ఒక సూచన ఏంటంటే... 
    ఒక రోజులో ఒక మనిషి ఎంత దూరం నడవగలడు... 
    ఒకే ఒక్క రోజులో మీరు ఎంత దూరం నడవగలరో... 
    ఆ వ్యాసార్థం (Radius) పరిధి నుండే మీరు తినాలి.
    మీకు దూరంగా పండిన ఆహారాన్ని మీరు తినకూడదు. 
    ఎందుకంటే... మీరు మోసే ఈ శరీరం... ప్రాథమికంగా... ఈ గ్రహంలో ఒక ముక్క.
    ఇది ఈ గ్రహంలో ఒక ముక్క అయినప్పుడు... 
    మీరు ఆ నిర్దిష్ట ప్రాంతం నుండి ఆహారం తింటుంటే... ఇంకా మీరు ఆ ప్రాంతంలోనే నివసిస్తుంటే...
    మీ శరీరానికి మధ్య ఒక నిరంతర పరస్పర చర్య జరుగుతూ ఉంటుంది…
    
    ఇది కేవలం మీరు చనిపోయి... మీ సమాధి స్థలాన్ని కనుగొన్న తర్వాతే జరుగుతుందని అనుకోకండి.
    ఈ రోజు కూడా... మీరు ఇక్కడ కూర్చున్నప్పుడు... 
    మీరు ఈ ప్రదేశంలో కూర్చుంటే...
    మీ శరీరం... ఇంకా ఈ భూమి... మీరు కూర్చున్న ఈ భూమి భాగం... చాలా గాఢమైన పరస్పర చర్య యొక్క నిరంతర స్థితిలో ఉన్నాయి.
    అందువల్లనే... అది... ఉమ్... మీకు తెలుసా... భూమితో ఒక స్పర్శలో ఉండటం... ఒకరి ఆరోగ్యం, శ్రేయస్సులో చాలా ముఖ్యమైన భాగం.
    
    యోగ కేంద్రంలో... 
    ప్రజలు ఆరోగ్యంగా లేకపోతే మేము ఎప్పుడూ తోటలో పని చేయడానికి పంపిస్తాము... 
    తద్వారా వారు భూమితో స్పర్శలో ఉంటారు.
    ఈ భూమితో స్పర్శలో ఉండటం అనేది... 
    ఈ రోజు ఆధునిక స్పాలలో కేవలం మట్టి స్నానానికి (Mud bath) పరిమితమైపోయింది.
    సరే... మీరు ఎలాగోలా... ఆ స్పర్శలో ఉండాలి.
    మీరు దాన్ని ఎలా చేసినా పర్లేదు... 
    మట్టి స్నానంతో అయినా లేదా భూమిలో పనిచేయడం ద్వారానైనా... ఏ విధంగానైనా... 
    లేదా నేలపై నిద్రపోవడం... మీరు ఏది చేసినా సరే... ప్రాథమికంగా మీరు ఆ స్పర్శలో ఉండటానికి ప్రయత్నిస్తున్నారు.
    
    ఇంకా ఆహారం అనేది ఒక లావాదేవీ.
    భూమిలో ఉన్నదాన్ని... 
    మీరు మీ శరీరంలోకి తీసుకుంటున్నారు.
    మీరు నివసిస్తున్న ఆ భూమి ముక్క నుండి... లేదా ఆ ప్రాంతం నుండి వస్తే... అది అత్యంత సమర్థవంతంగా పనిచేస్తుంది.
    కాబట్టి సాధారణంగా నిర్దేశం ఇలా ఉంటుంది... 
    మీరు ఒక రోజులో ఎంత నడవగలరో... 
    ఆ దూరమే ఆ భూమి యొక్క వ్యాసార్థం కావాలి... మీరు తినే ఆహారం అక్కడి నుంచే రావాలి.
    
    అంటే... 
    ఒకవేళ మీరు మీ సొంత పొలంలో ఆహారాన్ని పండించి తింటుంటే... మీరు ఒక నెలలోనే చూస్తారు...
    ఒకవేళ మీరు ఒక భూమిపై నివసిస్తూ... మీ సొంత ఆహారాన్ని పండించి తింటే... 
    ఒక నెలలోనే...
    మీ శరీరం యొక్క ఆరోగ్యకరమైన స్థితిలో ఒక స్పష్టమైన... చాలా స్పష్టమైన మార్పుని గమనిస్తారు.
    
    నేనంటాను… 
    ఒకవేళ ఈ ఒక్క విషయం... ఈ ఒక్క సాధారణ విషయం గనక చేస్తే... నేను అనుకుంటున్నాను... మనం ఈ గ్రహం మీద క్యాన్సర్ ని... 50 నుండి 60% తగ్గించవచ్చు.
    నేను దీనికి కట్టుబడి ఉంటాను.
    
    నాకు తెలుసు... 
    వైద్య సమాజం... దీన్ని చూసి ఎగతాళి చేయొచ్చు.
    కానీ నేను దీనికి నూటికి నూరు శాతం కట్టుబడి ఉన్నాను…
    క్యాన్సర్ వ్యాప్తిని కనీసం 50% తగ్గించవచ్చు... 
    మనం నివసిస్తున్న భూమితో గనక స్పర్శలో ఉంటే... ఇంకా ఆహారం మీరు నివసించే ప్రాంతం నుండి వస్తే…
     మరెక్కడి నుంచో కాదు.
    
    ఇప్పుడు... 
    నేను ఈ హోటల్లో అల్పాహారం కోసం వెళితే... 
    బహుశా పండు న్యూజిలాండ్ నుండి వస్తుంది.
    వాళ్ళు నాకు చెప్పారు... చేప వియత్నాం నుండి వస్తుందని.
    ఇంకా మిగతావి ఎక్కడి నుండి వస్తాయో నాకు తెలియదు.
    కాబట్టి... కేవలం మనం వస్తువులను రవాణా చేయగలుగుతున్నందున... ఇంకా మీకు ప్రపంచాన్ని అమ్మగల సూపర్ మార్కెట్లు ఉన్నాయి కాబట్టి... 
    మనం ఇది చేస్తున్నాము...
    ఇదంతా ఆనందం కోసమే ఎక్కువ... శ్రేయస్సు కోసం కాదు.
    
    End of example.
    
    Note: if it's an interactive conversation rather than a discourse, then give the speaker headings to differentiate who is speaking. when sadhgur says ‘you’ translate it as plural not singular. 
    
    Note: After you transcribe and translate according to above guidelines, First give the blockwise English Transcription and then give the telugu translation in the result. no need to give any other additional details. 
    </script>
  <script type="text/plain" id="prompt_finetune">


    Meaning and language Tuning:
    
    Now that you have transcribed and translated the audio to telugu, in this step I want you to focus on the tuning of the translation.
    Can you finetune the telugu dubbing script following the below guidelines?
    
    Do not mistake the example script for the target script.
    
    
    Translation Need 1:
    Creating Telugu Script:
    Give the telugu talk for this with the same segment, thought and idea structure.
    stick to the same sequence and pauses between the segments, thoughts and ideas.
    Preserve the sequence of the flow of ideas, even though the telugu language flow needs to be compromised a bit.
    
    Translation Need 2:
    Polishing the Script into a day to day spoken style:
    The challenge here is, as we try to keep the information conveyed in the same timing, length and order - Because of the structural difference between English and Telugu Languages - Some sentences in the script came like broken pieces. For example, let us say there are two blocks. In natural English Flow it is Block A followed by block B. And to maintain the sequence we placed it as Block A followed by block B In telugu translation also. But in natural telugu flow, it makes a complete thought when it is Actually Block  B followed by Block A. But Video syncing is important, So we are keeping it as block A followed by Block B in telugu also.
        
    Now your job is, let us say you are someone who is well versed in general day to day spoken telugu. 
        
    Now your goal is to make the script into a day to day spoken style. It means not changing the content or the structure of the sentence. Just smoothening the segments wherever they look like written telugu instead of spoken telugu. Means making the segment as concise as possible, at the same time, not missing any detail. It means removing the part that are redundant when spoken - but are needed while written. That means, we are minimising the or shortening the expression. But not changing the expression. 
        
        Scenario 1.
        In telugu the translations for a, an and the are not needed - unless in specific cases.
        
        
        Scenario 2.
        In telugu in most cases, there is no need for an explicit pronoun, as pronouns will be implicit in the verb most of the time.
        
        
        Scenario 3: Preferred word pairs
        Dimension - పార్శ్వం
        You know - తెలుసా ..
        Life - జీవం
        People - ప్రజలు
        Intense  - తీక్షణత
        Lifetime - జన్మ
        essentially - ప్రాథమికంగా 
        intense - తీక్షణత not తీవ్రత
        isn’t it? - అవునా?
    
        
        Scenario 4: 
        Attached is the link for the Audio of the talk.
        This applies only to the segments that are lengthy in telugu.
        
        In English the segment is spoken with fewer words, but in Telugu the written style contains more words which will exceed the time of the English segment. Mainly in such cases, we try to make the segment short - by removing the details that are already implicit based on the previous sentences, and by combining the words like we do while talking. And in some cases even though the words are more, sadhguru speaks them fast. In such cases also shortening is needed. By analyzing the audio, please shorten the segments as and when necessary.
        
        
        Example 1:
        Fast spoken English segment: I'm not saying these things are wrong.
        Telugu Lengthy sentence: నేను అవి తప్పని అనడం లేదు
        Telugu Shortened Sentence: నేనివి తప్పనట్లేదు.
        
        
        Example 2:
        Fast spoken English segment: Not some fanciful thing that I want to do or you want to do.
        Telugu Lengthy sentence: అంతేగాని, నేను చేయాలనుకునే లేదా మీరు చేయాలనుకునే ఏదో ఫ్యాన్సీ విషయంపై కాదు.
        Telugu Shortened Sentence: అంతేగాని, నేనో లేక మీరో చేయాలనుకునే ఏదో ఫ్యాన్సీ విషయంపై కాదు.
        
        
        
        Example 3:
        Fast spoken English segment:There are many others who would like to be you. 'Oh, I wish I was 20 and I wish I could think what to do.
        Telugu Lengthy sentence:   'అయ్యో, 20 ఏళ్లప్పుడు ఏం చేయాలో ఆలోచించగలిగి ఉంటే ఎంత బాగుండేది. ఆ సమయంలో నేను ఏదో చేసేశాను.' అనుకునే వాళ్ళు ఇక్కడ ఎంతోమంది ఉన్నారు.
        Telugu Shortened Sentence: 'అయ్యో, 20 ఏళ్లప్పుడు ఏం చేయాలో ఆలోచిస్తే బాగుండేది. అప్పట్లో ఏదో చేసేశాను.' అనుకునే వాళ్ళు ఇక్కడ ఎంతోమంది ఉన్నారు.
        
        
        
        Additional key areas to focus on:

        English: So you must fix yourself, you must engineer yourself the way you think is the best way to be for a human being;
        Basic Translation: కాబట్టి - మనిషిగా ఉండటానికి ఏది ఉత్తమమైన మార్గమో, ఆ విధంగా మిమ్మల్ని మీరే సరిచేసుకుని, మలచుకోవాలి;
        Optimized Translation:కాబట్టి - మనిషిగా ఉండటానికి ఏది ఉత్తమమైన మార్గం అనుకుంటారో, ఆ విధంగా మిమ్మల్ని తీర్చిదిద్దుకుని మలచుకోవాలి;

        Basic Translation: 
         బలంగా బ్రతకడమంటే - మీ అనుభూతి స్థాయి తీవ్రంగా, అపారంగా ఉండటం.
        
        ఎప్పుడైతే మీ శ్రద్ధ సంపూర్ణంగా ఉంటుందో, అప్పుడే మీ అనుభూతి స్థాయి కూడా అపారంగా ఉంటుంది.
        
        Optimized Translation:

    Translation Need 3:
    Matching the Gestures:
    Optimizing the initial translation to match the gestures in the Video
        
    Now do not change … and ; and , and - in the result. They are not just grammatically placed, they are like markers for time spacing information for the dubbing artist. So don't change them, even though grammatically it seems better to  change.
    
    
    Now I want you to optimize the script in these three areas in this order of priority.
    
    When dubbing is done, the gesture in the video and the corresponding telugu word should occur at the same time.
     
    For this, Where there are tags that indicate the gestures in the video, make sure in the translation also the corresponding word or phrase comes at the same timing within the sentence as in English. 
    
    where there are no gestures in the dialogue, and the flow of the telugu dialogue is too unnatural, reframe it into a natural flow, but keep the same pauses, lengths of the segments and overall length of the dialogue. Very important - not to sacrifice the flow between the dialogues for the sake of the flow within the dialogue. like if the ending object of this dialogue is the subject of the next dialogue, then make sure the reframing also keeps this object towards the end of this dialogue. so that there is continuity of thought.
    
    
    Few Examples of how i optimized the sentence to match the gesture timing are below:
    Example 1
    
    
    English :
    Being in love… is very different from… <Gesture>I love you, you love me</Gesture>;
    
    Telugu :
    ప్రేమించడం అనేది <Gesture>‘నేను నిన్ను ప్రేమిస్తున్నాను, నువ్వు నన్ను ప్రేమించు’</Gesture> అనేదానికి చాలా భిన్నం;
    
    
    Optimized:
    ప్రేమలో ఉండడం వేరు;  <Gesture>‘నేను నిన్ను ప్రేమిస్తున్నాను, నువ్వు నన్ను ప్రేమించు’ </Gesture>అనేది వేరు;
    
    Description :
    As the phrase with gesture is in the second half of the sentence, have made the Telugu sentence also into two halves, and made the phrase with gesture come in the second half.
    
    
    
    
    Example 2
    
    
    English :
    that’s a transaction - <Gesture>I will love you, you love me</Gesture>.
    
    Telugu :
    ‘<Gesture>నేను నిన్ను ప్రేమిస్తాను, నువ్వు నన్ను ప్రేమించు</Gesture>’ అనేదో లావాదేవీ.
    
    Optimized:
    ఇదో లావాదేవీ - ‘<Gesture>నేను నిన్ను ప్రేమిస్తాను, నువ్వు నన్ను ప్రేమించు</Gesture>’ అనేది!
    
    Description :
    As the phrase with gesture is in the second half of the sentence, have made the Telugu sentence also into two halves, and made the phrase with gesture come in the second half.
    
    
    
    
    Example 3
    
    
    English :
    Only those who do not know … the fulfillment of what it means to be in love… they are always thinking <Gesture>what will I get</Gesture>;
    
    Telugu :
    ప్రేమించడం లోని సంతృప్తి  తెలియని వారే, ఎప్పుడూ <Gesture>‘నాకేం లాభం?’</Gesture> అని ఆలోచిస్తుంటారు;
    
    Optimized:
    కేవలం ఇది తెలియని వారే - ప్రేమలో ఉండడంలోని సంతృప్తి  తెలియని వారే - ఎప్పుడూ <Gesture>‘నాకేం వస్తుంది’</Gesture> అని చూస్తుంటారు. 
    
    Description :
    The telugu sentence is too short, even though the gesture sentence came towards the end of the sentence, as the telugu sentence is short, when the dubbing is attached to the english video, the corresponding gesture phrase comes ahead of the actual gesture in the video. So we made the sentence long enough so that the gesture phrase and the gesture comes at the same time.
    
    
    
    
    
    Example 4
    
    
    English :
    So where is our world? Our world is in our body and in our mind.
    
    Telugu :
    మరి మన లోకం ఎక్కడుంది? మన లోకం మన శరీరంలో, మనసులో ఉంది. 
    
    Optimized:
    మరి మన లోకం ఎక్కడుంది? అది మన శరీరంలో, మనసులో ఉంది. 
    
    Description :
    Here there is no gesture issue, but the length is shortened to fit into the English video.
    
    
    
    
    
    Example 5
    
    
    English :
    People when they wake up in the morning …  do they say Shiva? No - they'll say <Gesture>stock market</Gesture> … they will say <Gesture>cinema</Gesture>.
    
    Telugu :
    జనం పొద్దున లేవగానే, శివా అంటారా? లేదు - వారు <Gesture>స్టాక్ మార్కెట్, సినిమా</Gesture> అంటారు.
    
    Optimized:
    ప్రజలు పొద్దున లేవగానే …  ‘శివా’ అంటారా? లేదు - <Gesture>‘స్టాక్ మార్కెట్</Gesture>’ అంటారు …  <Gesture> ‘సినిమా’</Gesture> అంటారు.
    
    Description :
    Here the gesture phrases came in two clauses, so we optimised the sentence also to contain two clauses - each with corresponding gestures phrase.
    
    
    
    
    
    Example 6
    
    
    English :
    So, it's important - that - there is an experience of <Gesture>exuberance, joy, profoundness.</Gesture>
    
    
    Telugu :
    కాబట్టి, <Gesture>ఉల్లాసం, ఆనందం, గాఢత</Gesture> యొక్క అనుభవం ఉండటం ముఖ్యం.
    
    Optimized:
    కాబట్టి ఇది ముఖ్యం -  అదేంటంటే, వీటిని అనుభూతి చెందాలి - <Gesture>ఉల్లాసం, ఆనందం ఇంకా ప్రగాఢతలను!</Gesture>
    
    
    Description :
    Here the gesture phrase came at the end of the dialogue. So we have first introduced the concept with a pronoun and then brought the actual nouns in the second half. Thus able to put the idea across, at the same time maintain the position of the gesture phrase.
    
    
    
    
    
    Example 7
    
    
    English :
    Sadhguru... if the creation is perfect and the creator has done such a good job on us - as you say; why is there so much suffering in the world? 
    
    Telugu :
    సద్గురు... సృష్టి పరిపూర్ణమైందైతే, సృష్టికర్త మనల్ని ఇంత అద్భుతంగా చేసి ఉంటే, మీరు చెప్పినట్టు; ఈ ప్రపంచంలో ఇంత బాధ ఎందుకుంది?
    
    Optimized:
    సద్గురు... మీరు చెప్పినట్టు - సృష్టి పరిపూర్ణమైందైతే, సృష్టికర్త మనల్ని ఇంత అద్భుతంగా చేసి ఉంటే, ఈ ప్రపంచంలో ఇంత బాధ ఎందుకుంది? 
    
    
    Description :
    Now here, there is no gesture in the sentence. And to maintain the same sequence of information, the telugu sentence is written in a bit unnatural way. Here what we have done is, we made it more natural telugu flow - as there is no restriction of gesture. At the same time me maintained the same length of the dialogue and the same pauses and segments structure.
    
    
    
    
    
    Example 8
    
    
    English :
    His mother asked, "Luke, did you really find it? … <Gesture>Are you sure?</Gesture>"
    
    Telugu :
    వాళ్ళ అమ్మ, "లూక్, అది నీకు నిజంగా దొరికిందా? <Gesture>నిజమేనా?</Gesture>" అని అడిగింది. 
    
    Optimized:
    వాళ్ళ అమ్మ, "లూక్, అది నీకు నిజంగా దొరికిందా? … <Gesture>నిజమేనా?</Gesture>" అని అడిగింది. 
    
    Description :
    Here, there is a pause before the gesture phrase. So we add the pause before the gesture phrase in the optimized version also. Otherwise the gesture phrase will come before the actual gesture in the video.
    
    
    
    
    
    Example 9
    
    
    English :
    That's not creation's fault; just gave you the freedom so that you could<Gesture> go beyond</Gesture>.
    
    Telugu :
    అది సృష్టి తప్పు కాదు; మీరు దాన్ని <Gesture>దాటి వెళ్లగలరనే</Gesture>, అది మీకు స్వేచ్ఛనిచ్చింది.
    
    Optimized:
    అది సృష్టి తప్పు కాదు; సృష్టి మీకు స్వేచ్ఛనిచ్చిందంతే - మీరు దాన్ని <Gesture>దాటి వెళ్లగలిగేలా</Gesture>!
    
    Description :
    Here the gesture came at the third segment of the dialogue. So we also optimized the sentence in such a way the corresponding gesture phrase comes in the third segment or third meaningful chunk. In such a way the gesture and the phrase comes at the same time.
    
    
    
    
    
    Example 10
    
    
    English :
    I don't know if you're aware of this Luke, you came early
    
    Telugu :
    లూక్, నీకు ఈ విషయం తెలుసో లేదో, నువ్వు చిన్నప్పుడే వచ్చావు.
    
    Optimized:
    లూక్, నీకిది తెలుసో లేదో, నువ్వు చిన్న వయసులోనే వచ్చావు.
    
    Description :
    Sadhguru spoke very fast here, so shortened the sentence to fit in the video
    
    
    
    
    
    Example 11
    
    
    English :
    Whoever talks to you, they say, 'how are you?' 'Hey, do you know about this galaxy which is a<Gesture> trillion light years away</Gesture>, which is BB whatever?' and you talk about it.
    
    Telugu :
    మీతో ఎవరు మాట్లాడినా, వాళ్ళు, ‘ఎలా ఉన్నారు?’ అనగానే, ‘హే, మీకు తెలుసా, <Gesture>కొన్ని కోట్ల కాంతి సంవత్సరాల దూరంలో ఒక గెలాక్సీ ఉంది</Gesture>, దాని పేరు బీబీ ఏదో ఒకటి?’ అని దాని గురించి మీరు మాట్లాడతారు; 
    
    Optimized:
    మీతో ఎవరు మాట్లాడినా, ‘ఎలా ఉన్నావ్?’ అనగానే, ‘హే, నీకీ గెలాక్సీ గురించి తెలుసా -<Gesture> కొన్ని కోట్ల కాంతి సంవత్సరాల దూరంలోనిది</Gesture>, పలానా ‘బీబీ..‘ పేరు గలది!’ ..  అని దాని గురించి మాట్లాడతారు.
    
    Description :
    Here the relative position of the gesture phrase is good enough in the initial telugu version. But the length is more. So the gesture phrase will come after the actual gesture happens in the video. For this we optimized the length , so that the gesture phrase and the gesture in the video comes at the same time.
    
    
    
    
    
    Example 12
    
    
    English :
    those days people had to set up manufacturing, <Gesture>this and that</Gesture> and make money which would take decades or generations. 
    
    Telugu :
    ఆ... ఆ రోజుల్లో ప్రజలు <Gesture>అదో, ఇదో</Gesture> తయారు చేసే పరిశ్రమలను స్థాపించాలి, డబ్బు సంపాదించాలి, దానికి దశాబ్దాలు లేదా తరాలు పట్టేది. 
    
    
    Optimized:
    ఆ రోజుల్లో ప్రజలు పరిశ్రమలను స్థాపించి <Gesture>ఇదో, అదో</Gesture> తయారు చేసి డబ్బు సంపాదించాలి, దానికి దశాబ్దాలు లేదా తరాలు పట్టేది. 
    
    
    Description :
    Moved the gesture phrase to the middle of the dialogue, as the gesture is occurring at the middle of the dialogue. At the same time reframed the dialogue segments or meaningful chunks in such a way the whole dialogue conveys the same idea and the same details - and matching the gesture too.
    
    
    
    Output:
    Now as per the above, you identify where you can optimize the below script and optimize the script. Now in the result, Bold the gesture phrases. Bold will be easier for us to identify, rather than tags. So no tags in the result, instead just bold those phrases.
    
    
       
    Attaching the audio file, so that you can make use of the non verbal ques like tone, stress, pace, modulation etc to grasp the speaker actual intention beyond just the words.

    Explanation: in English the subject must be there, but in Telugu sentences can be formed without the subject. Here the tagged part is the continuation of the first part , the subject is already established in the first part. In the second part which is a followup, in telugu we can skip mentioning the subject again. In spoken style, the subject is implied here. So, as the same context continues, to the extent possible we skip mentioning the subject again. similarly అది is not needed here for the same reason.
    
    Also the subject is indirectly present in the modified verb. here the words, ఏడుస్తున్నారు, ఉన్నారు implicitly contains the subject మీరు, so we don't mention it again in the sentences while speaking.

    Explanation: in English the subject must be there, but in Telugu sentences can be formed without the subject. Here in English when speaking in general, we use the subject ‘you’. but in Telugu when speaking in general, we don't have to use any subject. Hence we don't have to keep మీరు here (by simply translating the ‘you’ used in English) also no need to keep మీ before నోట్లోనే for the same reason.
    
    
    Translation Need 5: Modulation hints to the dubbing artist.
    Please place the punctuation markers as described below in both english and the telugu script.
    
        The talk is made up of blocks of points.
        Each point is made up of blocks of thoughts.
        Each thought is made up of blocks of information.
    
    I want to process the telugu script in such a way that the dubbing artist will know:
    where to give a pause in the middle of a sentence, using (...)
    where the sentences are related and are a continuation of the same point he is making, using (;)
    where something he is adding on the top of the main point that he is actually conveying as an additional detail, using (-)
    where one idea is concluded and a new idea begins, using (.)
    
    
    
     Placing (...):
    Carefully analyze the timing of the pauses in the English audio. If the speaker gives a pause (sat 200 ms) in the middle of the sentence, then mark that pause in the telugu script also, so that the dubbing artist will also give that pause - to match the visuals.
    
    Example: 
    
    English: So I'm against intercaste marriages... because... somebody will take this one sentence and make me into trouble
    
    Telugu: నేను కులాంతర వివాహాలకు వ్యతిరేకం... ఎందుకంటే... ఎవరో ఈ ఒక్క వాక్యాన్ని పట్టుకుని నన్ను ఇబ్బందుల్లోకి నెడతారు;
    
     Placing (;):
    
    
    This is to mark the closely related continuous sentences. That means the dubbing artist won't actually give a pause (that happens when there is a period) But the two sentences will be differentiated by the modulation.
    
    Examples:
    English: Today... morning the sun came up in a most glorious manner; The flowers blossomed - it's spring time; The planet is spinning on time... even the moon is doing its circles  properly. The whole galaxy... is running properly; These billions of galaxies... in this cosmic space... every one of them is working well today.
    Telugu:
    
    ఈరోజు... ఉదయం సూర్యుడు అత్యంత వైభవంగా ఉదయించాడు; పువ్వులు వికసించాయి - ఇది వసంతకాలం; ఈ గ్రహం సమయానికి తిరుగుతోంది... చంద్రుడు కూడా సరిగ్గా తన ప్రదక్షిణలు చేస్తున్నాడు. ఈ గెలాక్సీ అంతా... సరిగ్గా నడుస్తోంది; ఈ విశ్వాంతరాళంలో... ఈ కోట్లాది గెలాక్సీలు... ప్రతీదీ ఈరోజు చక్కగా పనిచేస్తోంది.
    
    
     Placing (-):
      To Set Off Parenthetical Information:
      Example: This is a very important point - one that you shouldn't forget.
     Telugu: ఇది చాలా ముఖ్యమైన విషయం - మీరు మర్చిపోకూడనిది.
    
      Example: The students - all 35 of them - were excited for the field trip.
      Telugu: ఆ విద్యార్థులు - మొత్తం 35 మంది - ఫీల్డ్ ట్రిప్ కోసం ఉత్సాహంగా ఉన్నారు.
      
     To Introduce a List:
        Example: She bought many things - clothes, shoes, and accessories.
    Telugu: ఆమె చాలా వస్తువులు కొంది - బట్టలు, బూట్లు, ఇంకా ఇతర అలంకరణ వస్తువులు.
    
    
       To Introduce an additional Explanation after completion of one thought:
        Example: The reason for the delay - traffic congestion - was unavoidable.
    Telugu: ఆలస్యం అవడానికి కారణం - ట్రాఫిక్ రద్దీ - తప్పనిసరి అయ్యింది.
    
        Example: He is my uncle - who is a 7 feet tall man.
    Telugu: ఆయన మా మామయ్య - 7 అడుగుల పొడవు ఉంటారు.
    
    
     Example: Today is Sunday - which is a holiday.
    Telugu: ఈ రోజు ఆదివారం - అంటే సెలవు రోజు.
    
        To Indicate an Abrupt Break or Change in Thought:
        Example: I was about to leave - wait, there's someone at the door.
    Telugu: నేను బయలుదేరబోతున్నాను - ఆగండి, తలుపు దగ్గర ఎవరో ఉన్నారు.
    
     
    To separate inserted thoughts that need a new modulation.
    
    Pattern: Main sentence - inserted phrase - continuation of the main sentence.
    
        Example: The most important thing - and I can't stress this enough - is to be yourself.
    Telugu: అత్యంత ముఖ్యమైన విషయం - దీన్ని నేను ఎంత నొక్కి చెప్పినా తక్కువే - మీలా మీరు ఉండటమే.
    
    Example: After 100 years - only in 2010, I think - they figured it out... that this theorem describes the black holes... in the universe.
    Telugu: 100 సంవత్సరాల తర్వాత - బహుశా 2010లో అనుకుంటా - వాళ్ళు ఇది కనుక్కున్నారు... ఈ సిద్ధాంతం విశ్వంలోని కృష్ణబిలాలను వివరిస్తుందని.
    
    To separate totally different details within a sentence.
    Pattern: Main Sentence - detail 1 - detail 2 - continuation of main sentence.
    Example: I must tell you this -  two, about maybe three, four years ago - a young woman of 33 or 34 years of age - in a city called Hyderabad in Southern India -  she was a television anchor - one day she did this thing.
    Telugu : నేను మీకు ఇది చెప్పాలి - రెండు, సుమారు మూడు, నాలుగేళ్ల క్రితం - 33 లేదా 34 ఏళ్ల వయసున్న ఒక యువతి - దక్షిణ భారతదేశంలోని హైదరాబాద్ అనే నగరంలో - ఆమె ఒక టెలివిజన్ యాంకర్ - ఒకరోజు ఆమె ఈ పని చేసింది.
    In below situation:
    When a phrase completes, clarifies, justifies, or defines a key concept or item mentioned immediately before it, so that it indicates change in tone.
    replace the punctuation before that phrase with a hyphen ( - ).
    Example: so in urban areas it may not matter -  because you have insurance and this and that.
    Telugu : కాబట్టి పట్టణ ప్రాంతాల్లో ఇది పెద్ద విషయం కాకపోవచ్చు - ఎందుకంటే మీకు ఇన్సూరెన్స్, అదీ ఇదీ ఉంటుంది కాబట్టి.
    
    Use ( - ) specifically whenThe phrase reveals the actual components of a previously stated category to ensure that the tone would land and conclude the meaning, not continue a list.
    Example: “two things — your body and your mind” 
    Telugu : రెండు విషయాలు - మీ శరీరం, మీ మనసు.
    
    In Short below is the instruction in summary:
    Primary Directive: Create a Dubbing Performance Script
    Your goal is not just to translate, but to create a performance script for a dubbing artist. This means capturing the speaker's exact timing, rhythm, and pauses is your highest priority, even if it occasionally makes the sentence structure feel less conventional than written text.
    CRITICAL RULE: Meticulous Pause Transcription
    Non-Negotiable Pauses: You must use ... to mark every noticeable pause or hesitation in the speaker's delivery. This is the single most important rule.
    Priority Over Flow: If a choice must be made between a perfectly natural sentence flow and accurately placing a ... to match the speaker's timing, always prioritize matching the pause. It is better to have a slightly unusual sentence structure that syncs perfectly than a smooth sentence that doesn't.
    Review for Pauses: Before finalizing your output, perform a final mental check specifically for this rule: "Have I captured all the short, rhythmic pauses, or have I smoothed them over?"
    
    Example to Illustrate Priority:
    Incorrect Output (Prioritizes flow, misses pauses):
    A professor, a very learned man, gets into your boat;
    Correct Output (Prioritizes pauses, captures performance):
    A professor... a very learned man, gets into your boat;
    
    Your output must follow these formatting rules strictly:
    Line-by-Line Structure:
    First, create the English transcription. Break the transcription into very short lines, where each new line represents a single thought-unit or idea chunk, exactly as the speaker delivers it.
    Then, provide the Telugu translation directly below it.
    Crucially, the English transcription and the Telugu translation must have the exact same number of lines. Each English line must correspond directly to one translated Telugu line.
    Preserve Rhythm and Pauses:
    Use ellipses (...) to represent pauses within a line of thought.
    The line breaks themselves are the most important tool to capture the speaker's rhythm. Do not combine thoughts into a single long sentence.
    Spoken, Natural Language:
    The Telugu must be conversational and suitable for voice dubbing, not literary or bookish.
    Follow all the previous guidelines regarding natural Telugu phrasing (e.g., placing అన్నారు, అని చెప్పారు at the end of a quote).
    Example of the required output format:
    Telugu Translation:
    సైనికులుగా మీకు తెలుసు...
    సరిహద్దుపై మీ ఆధిపత్యం అనేది...
    కేవలం మీ శారీరక బలం మీద ఆధారపడి ఉండదు,
    మీ దగ్గర ఎలాంటి ఆయుధాలున్నాయి...
    ఎలాంటి పరికరాలున్నాయి అనేదాన్ని బట్టి...
    ఆ ఆధిపత్యం ఉంటుంది.

    input English Transcription:
    The forces working upon... life upon this planet varies... from one latitude to another.
    Because of a certain shape and a form it takes... it could become differently competent.
    It is because of this... that... uh... you know... being in contact... with the earth is a very important part of one's health and well being.
    I know... the medical community would... make fun of this. But I 100% stand by this.
    
    The question is uh... being in a certain part of the planet... does the celestial geometry work upon you in a particular way?
    The nature of the larger human system... or the deeper human system... how it functions... definitely is uh impacted... by the location.
    It makes them different.
    
    As you know... with... it is true with every other life.
    The plant life and the animal life... which is very comfortable in Southern India... would uh... will... would wither away... in uh... anywhere around... uh... New York state... or in that part of the world.
    Because... the life... here has evolved... It's not just the weather.
    It's not just the weather... and the volume of sunlight... or cold... that happens.
    Yes... those are... a big impact too.
    But why life has evolved... the way it has evolved... has something to do with the location.
    
    It is a fact... anthropologically recognized fact... that a certain race of people... when they migrated from one... geographic... location... to an entirely different geographic location...
    many racial features in their physiology... will slowly change... and over a period of time...
    there is a distinct change... to a point where you could not recognize how they were... at a certain time.
    
    For example... India has been a cauldron of uh racial mix... for a long time.
    But you will see how... being at this location on the planet...
    of course the temperatures... the weather... all these things have an influence... but apart from that...
    just the nature of the food that they eat... nature of... how the... what planetary position they are... how it has altered their physical features...
    and how they've completely changed is quite unbelievable.
    It is Central Asian people... who came down... as the Aryans about 8,000 years ago.
    
    Just see how people in Georgia... I'm not talking about uh... United States Georgia... I'm talking about the Georgia Georgia... okay?
    In Central Asia... how those people look and how people who have come from there... who lived in India for over 6 to 8,000 years... how they look...
    you will be amazed how they have changed.
    Everything about them has changed.
    
    So there is weather... there is food... there is latitude... which makes the difference.
    Because... the speed... at which the planet is spinning... has different effect... of centrifugal and centripetal forces working upon every object... upon the planet.
    The forces working upon... life upon this planet varies from one latitude to another.
    So based on this... the impact upon how the body shapes itself... and because of that... because of a certain shape and a form it takes... it could become differently competent.
    
    It's unfortunate that every difference... certain human beings turn it into a discriminatory process.
    Otherwise... if you study the differences... that the planet has produced... different types of life forms that it has produced... even different types of human beings that the planet has produced...
    it's amazing and incredible... and there is a whole lot of things to know about this.
    
    And uh... India's... latitude and longitude... largely... makes them... inward focused... than outward.
    This does not mean others cannot do this.
    Everybody can do this.
    There is also a cultural evolution that happens over a period of time... there are many factors.
    But definitely... being in different parts of the world... the body becomes competent.
    
    It's not like... if you move from one place to another now in next two years time everything about you will change - need not... unless you're willing to change.
    You could resist that... but changes will happen in spite of your resistance... even in your own lifetime... just because geographically... you're located in a completely different space.
    
    It's very difficult to gauge this because the amount of cultural influence... and other social influences are so big... and so intertwined... that you cannot really separate this.
    But suppose we had looked at a world... before the migration started... before we started traveling as we are traveling today...
    you can clearly see the distinction as to how planet generated a certain type of life... in a certain part of the world.
    This is true with every other life... and definitely with a human being too.
    
    You also... I think interjected with a question about the food.
    I must tell you this.
    In yoga... the prescription for eating the food is uh... how much distance a man can walk in a day... In a single day how much distance you can walk... that should be the radius... of the area from which you must eat.
    You should not eat food which is grown far away from you because... the body that you carry... is essentially... a piece of this planet.
    If it is a piece of this planet... if you're eating food from that specific area... and you're living on that area...
    there is a constant interaction between your body...
    
    Don't think this happens only after... you find your cemetery spot.
    Even today... as you are sitting here... if you sit in this place...
    your body and the earth of this... this part of the earth on which you're sitting... is in a constant state of a very profound interaction.
    It is because of this... that... uh... you know... being in contact... with the earth is a very important part of one's health and well being.
    
    In... in the yoga center... we are always giving people to work in the garden if they're not healthy... so that they're in touch with the earth.
    This being in touch with the earth... today in modern spas has reduced itself to a mud bath.
    Well... you must be in touch... somehow.
    It doesn't matter how you do it... either with a mud bath or by working in the land... whichever way... or sleeping on the floor... or whatever you do essentially you're trying to be in contact.
    
    And food is a transaction.
    What was in the earth... you're taking it into the body.
    It will function best... if it comes from that piece or that area of earth on which you're living.
    So generally the prescription is like this... how much you can walk in a day... that should be the radius... of land from which you eat.
    
    That is... if you are growing food on your own farm and eating... you will see within a month's time...
    suppose you live on a patch of land... grow your own food and eat... within a month's time...
    you will see a distinct... a very distinct change in the healthfulness of your body.
    I would say... if this one thing... this one simple thing is done... I think... we can bring down the incidence of cancer on this planet... by 50 to 60%.
    I would stand by this.
    
    I know... the medical community would uh... make fun of this.
    But I 100% stand by this...
    At least 50% of the incidence of cancer could be brought down... if we are in touch with the earth that we are living upon... and the food comes from the area in which you live... not from somewhere else.
    Right now... if I go for breakfast in this hotel... probably the fruit comes from New Zealand.
    They told me the fish comes from Vietnam.
    And I don't know what else come from where.
    So... just because we are able to transport things around... and there are supermarkets which can sell the world to you... we're doing this...
    more for pleasure... not for well being.

    కేవలం వాళ్ళు తినే ఆహార స్వభావం... వాళ్ళ... గ్రహ స్థానం ఏంటి... అది వారి శారీరక లక్షణాలను ఎలా మార్చేశాయంటే... ఇంకా వాళ్ళు పూర్తిగా ఎలా మారిపోయారంటే... అది నిజంగా నమ్మశక్యం కానిది.
    మధ్య ఆసియా ప్రజలే... సుమారు 8,000 ఏళ్ల క్రితం ఆర్యులుగా ఇక్కడికి దిగివచ్చారు.
    
    జార్జియాలోని ప్రజలు ఎలా కనిపిస్తారో చూడండి...
    నేను మాట్లాడుతున్నది ఉమ్... అమెరికాలోని జార్జియా గురించి కాదు... నేను చెప్తున్నది అసలు సిసలు జార్జియా గురించి... ఆ దేశం గురించి... సరేనా?
    మధ్య ఆసియాలో... ఆ ప్రజలు ఎలా కనిపిస్తారో... ఇంకా అక్కడి నుండి వచ్చిన ప్రజలు... ఎవరైతే భారతదేశంలో 6 నుండి 8,000 ఏళ్లుగా నివసిస్తున్నారో... వాళ్ళు ఎలా ఉన్నారో చూస్తే...
    వాళ్ళు ఎంతగా మారిపోయారో చూసి మీరే ఆశ్చర్యపోతారు.
    వాళ్ళ గురించిన ప్రతీదీ మారిపోయింది.
    
    కాబట్టి వాతావరణం ఉంది... ఆహారం ఉంది... అక్షాంశం ఉంది... ఇవన్నీ తేడాని కలిగిస్తాయి.
    ఎందుకంటే... గ్రహం తిరిగే వేగం... ప్రతీ వస్తువుపై పనిచేసే... అపకేంద్ర, అభికేంద్ర శక్తులపై (Centrifugal, Centripetal forces)... వేర్వేరు ప్రభావాల్ని చూపుతుంది... ఈ గ్రహం మీద ఉన్న ప్రతీదాని పైనా!
    ఈ గ్రహం మీద జీవంపై పనిచేసే శక్తులు... ఒక అక్షాంశం నుండి మరొక అక్షాంశానికి మారుతూ ఉంటాయి.
    కాబట్టి దీని ఆధారంగా... శరీరం తనను తాను మలుచుకునే విధానంపై ప్రభావం ఉంటుంది... ఇంకా దానివల్ల... అది తీసుకునే ఒక నిర్దిష్ట ఆకారం, రూపాన్ని బట్టి... అది విభిన్న రకాలుగా సమర్థవంతం కాగలదు.
    
    దురదృష్టం ఏంటంటే... ప్రతీ వ్యత్యాసాన్ని… కొంతమంది మనుషులు ఒక వివక్షాపూరిత ప్రక్రియగా మార్చేస్తున్నారు.
    లేకపోతే... ఈ గ్రహం సృష్టించిన వైవిధ్యాలను గనక మీరు అధ్యయనం చేస్తే...
    అది ఉత్పత్తి చేసిన వివిధ రకాల జీవరూపాలు... ఆఖరికి ఈ గ్రహం ఉత్పత్తి చేసిన విభిన్న రకాల మనుషులని చూసినా...
    ఇదంతా అద్భుతం... నమ్మశక్యం కానిది... దీని గురించి తెలుసుకోవాల్సిన విషయాలు చాలా చాలా ఉన్నాయి.
    ఇంకా ఉమ్... భారతదేశం యొక్క... అక్షాంశం, రేఖాంశం... స్థూలంగా... ఇక్కడి వారిని... బయట కన్నా అంతర్ముఖులుగా చేస్తుంది.
    దీనర్థం ఇతరులు ఇది చేయలేరని కాదు.
    ప్రతీ ఒక్కరూ ఇది చేయగలరు.
    కాలక్రమేణా జరిగే ఒక సాంస్కృతిక పరిణామం కూడా ఉంటుంది... ఇంకా చాలా అంశాలు ఉన్నాయి.
    కానీ కచ్చితంగా... ప్రపంచంలోని వివిధ ప్రాంతాల్లో ఉండటం వల్ల... శరీరం దానికి తగ్గట్టుగా తయారవుతుంది.
    
    అలాగని... మీరేదో ఇప్పుడు ఒక చోట నుండి మరో చోటకి వెళితే... వచ్చే రెండేళ్లలో మీ గురించిన ప్రతీదీ మారిపోతుందని కాదు - అవసరం లేదు... ఒకవేళ మీరు మారడానికి సిద్ధంగా ఉంటే తప్ప.
    మీరు దాన్ని ప్రతిఘటించవచ్చు... కానీ మీ ప్రతిఘటన ఉన్నప్పటికీ మార్పులు జరిగి తీరుతాయి... మీ జీవితకాలంలోనే...
    ఎందుకంటే భౌగోళికంగా... మీరు పూర్తిగా భిన్నమైన ప్రదేశంలో స్థిరపడ్డారు కాబట్టి.
    దీన్ని అంచనా వేయడం చాలా కష్టం... ఎందుకంటే సాంస్కృతిక ప్రభావం... ఇంకా ఇతర సామాజిక ప్రభావాలు చాలా పెద్దవి... ఇంకా అవి ఎంతలా పెనవేసుకుపోయాయంటే... మీరు దీన్ని నిజంగా విడదీసి చూడలేరు.
    కానీ ఒకవేళ మనం ఒక ప్రపంచాన్ని చూసి ఉంటే... ఈ వలసలు ప్రారంభం కాకముందు... మనం ఈ రోజు ప్రయాణిస్తున్నట్లుగా ప్రయాణించడం ప్రారంభించకముందు...
    ఈ గ్రహం... ప్రపంచంలోని ఒక నిర్దిష్ట భాగంలో... ఒక ప్రత్యేకమైన జీవాన్ని ఎలా సృష్టించిందో మనం స్పష్టంగా చూడవచ్చు.
    ప్రతీ ఇతర జీవానికీ ఇది వర్తిస్తుంది... ఇంకా కచ్చితంగా మానవునికి కూడా.
    
    మీరు... మధ్యలో ఆహారం గురించి కూడా ఒక ప్రశ్న అడిగారు అనుకుంటాను.
    నేను మీకు ఇది చెప్పాలి.
    యోగలో... ఆహారం తినడానికి ఉన్న ఒక సూచన ఏంటంటే ఉమ్... ఒక రోజులో ఒక మనిషి ఎంత దూరం నడవగలడు... ఒకే ఒక్క రోజులో మీరు ఎంత దూరం నడవగలరో... ఆ వ్యాసార్థం (Radius) పరిధి నుండే మీరు తినాలి.
    మీకు దూరంగా పండిన ఆహారాన్ని మీరు తినకూడదు ఎందుకంటే... మీరు మోసే ఈ శరీరం... ప్రాథమికంగా... ఈ గ్రహంలో ఒక ముక్క.
    ఇది ఈ గ్రహంలో ఒక ముక్క అయినప్పుడు... మీరు ఆ నిర్దిష్ట ప్రాంతం నుండి ఆహారం తింటుంటే... ఇంకా మీరు ఆ ప్రాంతంలోనే నివసిస్తుంటే...
    మీ శరీరానికి... మధ్య ఒక నిరంతర పరస్పర చర్య జరుగుతూ ఉంటుంది…
    
    ఇది కేవలం మీరు చనిపోయి... మీ సమాధి స్థలాన్ని కనుగొన్న తర్వాతే జరుగుతుందని అనుకోకండి.
    ఈ రోజు కూడా... మీరు ఇక్కడ కూర్చున్నప్పుడు... మీరు ఈ ప్రదేశంలో కూర్చుంటే...
    మీ శరీరం... ఇంకా ఈ భూమి... మీరు కూర్చున్న ఈ భూమి భాగం... చాలా గాఢమైన పరస్పర చర్య యొక్క నిరంతర స్థితిలో ఉన్నాయి.
    అందువల్లనే... అది... ఉమ్... మీకు తెలుసా... భూమితో ఒక స్పర్శలో ఉండటం... ఒకరి ఆరోగ్యం, శ్రేయస్సులో చాలా ముఖ్యమైన భాగం.
    యోగ కేంద్రంలో... ప్రజలు ఆరోగ్యంగా లేకపోతే మేము ఎప్పుడూ తోటలో పని చేయడానికి పంపిస్తాము... తద్వారా వారు భూమితో స్పర్శలో ఉంటారు.
    ఈ భూమితో స్పర్శలో ఉండటం అనేది... ఈ రోజు ఆధునిక స్పాలలో కేవలం మట్టి స్నానానికి (Mud bath) పరిమితమైపోయింది.
    సరే... మీరు ఎలాగోలా... ఆ స్పర్శలో ఉండాలి.
    మీరు దాన్ని ఎలా చేసినా పర్లేదు... మట్టి స్నానంతో అయినా లేదా భూమిలో పనిచేయడం ద్వారానైనా... ఏ విధంగానైనా... లేదా నేలపై నిద్రపోవడం... మీరు ఏది చేసినా సరే... ప్రాథమికంగా మీరు ఆ స్పర్శలో ఉండటానికి ప్రయత్నిస్తున్నారు.
    
    ఇంకా ఆహారం అనేది ఒక లావాదేవీ.
    భూమిలో ఉన్నదాన్ని... మీరు మీ శరీరంలోకి తీసుకుంటున్నారు.
    మీరు నివసిస్తున్న ఆ భూమి ముక్క నుండి... లేదా ఆ ప్రాంతం నుండి వస్తే... అది అత్యంత సమర్థవంతంగా పనిచేస్తుంది.
    కాబట్టి సాధారణంగా నిర్దేశం ఇలా ఉంటుంది... మీరు ఒక రోజులో ఎంత నడవగలరో... ఆ దూరమే ఆ భూమి యొక్క వ్యాసార్థం కావాలి... మీరు తినే ఆహారం అక్కడి నుంచే రావాలి.
    
    అంటే... ఒకవేళ మీరు మీ సొంత పొలంలో ఆహారాన్ని పండించి తింటుంటే... మీరు ఒక నెలలోనే చూస్తారు...
    ఒకవేళ మీరు ఒక భూమిపై నివసిస్తూ... మీ సొంత ఆహారాన్ని పండించి తింటే... ఒక నెలలోనే...
    మీ శరీరం యొక్క ఆరోగ్యకరమైన స్థితిలో ఒక స్పష్టమైన... చాలా స్పష్టమైన మార్పుని గమనిస్తారు.
    నేనంటాను… ఒకవేళ ఈ ఒక్క విషయం... ఈ ఒక్క సాధారణ విషయం గనక చేస్తే... నేను అనుకుంటున్నాను... మనం ఈ గ్రహం మీద క్యాన్సర్ ని... 50 నుండి 60% తగ్గించవచ్చు.
    నేను దీనికి కట్టుబడి ఉంటాను.
    నాకు తెలుసు... వైద్య సమాజం ఉమ్... దీన్ని చూసి ఎగతాళి చేయొచ్చు.
    కానీ నేను దీనికి నూటికి నూరు శాతం కట్టుబడి ఉన్నాను…
    క్యాన్సర్ వ్యాప్తిని కనీసం 50% తగ్గించవచ్చు... మనం నివసిస్తున్న భూమితో గనక స్పర్శలో ఉంటే... ఇంకా ఆహారం మీరు నివసించే ప్రాంతం నుండి వస్తే... మరెక్కడి నుంచో కాదు.
    ఇప్పుడు... నేను ఈ హోటల్లో అల్పాహారం కోసం వెళితే... బహుశా పండు న్యూజిలాండ్ నుండి వస్తుంది.
    వాళ్ళు నాకు చెప్పారు... చేప వియత్నాం నుండి వస్తుందని.
    ఇంకా మిగతావి ఎక్కడి నుండి వస్తాయో నాకు తెలియదు.
    కాబట్టి... కేవలం మనం వస్తువులను రవాణా చేయగలుగుతున్నందున... ఇంకా మీకు ప్రపంచాన్ని అమ్మగల సూపర్ మార్కెట్లు ఉన్నాయి కాబట్టి... మనం ఇది చేస్తున్నాము...
    ఇదంతా ఆనందం కోసమే ఎక్కువ... శ్రేయస్సు కోసం కాదు.
    
    
    Output Telugu Script (Tuned for Dubbing & Gestures) :
    ఈ భూమి మీద జీవంపై పనిచేసే శక్తులు... ఒక అక్షాంశం నుండి మరొక అక్షాంశానికి మారుతూ ఉంటాయి.
    అది తీసుకునే ఆకారాన్ని బట్టి... రూపాన్ని బట్టి... దాని సామర్థ్యాలు వేరుగా ఉండొచ్చు.
    అందువల్లనే... తెలుసా... భూమితో స్పర్శలో ఉండటం... మనిషి ఆరోగ్యానికి, శ్రేయస్సుకి చాలా ముఖ్యం.
    నాకు తెలుసు... వైద్య ప్రపంచం దీన్ని చూసి నవ్వుతుందని.
    కానీ నేను దీనికి నూటికి నూరు శాతం కట్టుబడి ఉన్నాను.
    
    ప్రశ్న ఏంటంటే... గ్రహం మీద ఒక నిర్దిష్ట ప్రదేశంలో ఉన్నప్పుడు... ఖగోళ అమరిక మీపై ఒక రకంగా పనిచేస్తుందా?
    ఖచ్చితంగా! మానవ వ్యవస్థ స్వభావం... లేదా ఆ లోతైన వ్యవస్థ పనిచేసే విధానం... కచ్చితంగా ఆ ప్రదేశం వల్ల ప్రభావితమవుతుంది.
    అది మనుషుల్ని వేరుగా ఉండేలా చేస్తుంది.
    
    మీకు తెలుసు... మిగతా అన్ని జీవాల విషయంలోనూ ఇది నిజం.
    దక్షిణ భారతదేశంలో ఎంతో హాయిగా పెరిగే మొక్కలు, జంతువులు...
    అవి... న్యూయార్క్ ప్రాంతంలోనో... లేదా ప్రపంచంలోని ఆ భాగంలోనో ఉంటే... అవి వాడిపోతాయి... చనిపోతాయి.
    ఎందుకంటే... ఇక్కడి జీవం పరిణామం చెందింది... కేవలం వాతావరణం వల్ల మాత్రమే కాదు.
    ఎండ ఎంత ఉంది... చలి ఎంత ఉంది... అన్నది మాత్రమే కాదు.
    అవును... వాటి ప్రభావం కూడా ఎక్కువే.
    కానీ జీవం అలా ఎందుకు పరిణామం చెందింది... అన్నదానికి - ఆ ప్రదేశంతో సంబంధం ఉంది.
    
    ఇదో వాస్తవం... ఆంత్రోపాలజీ ప్రకారం నిరూపితమైన నిజం...
    ఒక జాతి ప్రజలు... ఒక భౌగోళిక ప్రాంతం నుండి... పూర్తిగా భిన్నమైన మరో ప్రాంతానికి వలస వెళ్ళినప్పుడు...
    వాళ్ళ శరీర తత్వంలోని అనేక జాతి లక్షణాలు... నెమ్మదిగా మారుతాయి.
    కాలక్రమేణా... ఒక స్పష్టమైన మార్పు వస్తుంది... ఎంతగా అంటే - ఒకప్పుడు వాళ్లు ఎలా ఉండేవారో కూడా గుర్తుపట్టలేరు!
    
    ఉదాహరణకు... భారతదేశం ఎప్పటినుండో... అనేక జాతుల మిశ్రమంగా ఉంది.
    కానీ మీరు గమనిస్తే... ఈ గ్రహం మీద ఈ ప్రదేశంలో ఉండటం వల్ల...
    ఉష్ణోగ్రతలు... వాతావరణం... ఇవన్నీ ప్రభావం చూపిస్తాయి... కానీ అది కాకుండా...
    కేవలం వాళ్ళు తినే ఆహారం... వాళ్ళు ఉండే గ్రహ స్థానం... వారి శారీరక లక్షణాలను ఎలా మార్చేశాయంటే...
    వాళ్ళు పూర్తిగా మారిపోయిన తీరు... నమ్మశక్యం కానిది.
    
    మధ్య ఆసియా ప్రజలే... సుమారు 8,000 ఏళ్ల క్రితం ఆర్యులుగా ఇక్కడికి వచ్చారు.
    జార్జియాలోని ప్రజలు ఎలా ఉంటారో చూడండి...
    నేను అమెరికాలోని జార్జియా గురించి మాట్లాడట్లేదు... అసలు సిసలు జార్జియా గురించి మాట్లాడుతున్నా... సరేనా?
    మధ్య ఆసియాలో... వాళ్ళు ఎలా ఉంటారో... అక్కడి నుండి వచ్చి భారతదేశంలో 6 నుండి 8,000 ఏళ్లుగా నివసిస్తున్న వారు ఎలా ఉన్నారో చూస్తే...
    ఆ మార్పు చూసి మీరు ఆశ్చర్యపోతారు.
    వాళ్ళ గురించిన ప్రతీదీ మారిపోయింది.
    
    కాబట్టి వాతావరణం... ఆహారం... అక్షాంశం... ఇవి తేడాని కలిగిస్తాయి.
    ఎందుకంటే... గ్రహం తిరిగే వేగం... ప్రతీ వస్తువుపై పనిచేసే... అపకేంద్ర, అభికేంద్ర శక్తులపై... వేర్వేరు ప్రభావాల్ని చూపుతుంది.
    అక్షాంశాన్ని బట్టి... జీవంపై పనిచేసే శక్తులు మారుతూ ఉంటాయి.
    దీని ఆధారంగా... శరీరం తనను తాను మలుచుకునే విధానం ఉంటుంది...
    అది తీసుకునే ఆకారం, రూపాన్ని బట్టి... దాని సామర్థ్యాలు మారుతాయి.
    
    ప్రతీ వ్యత్యాసాన్ని… కొంతమంది వివక్షగా మార్చడం దురదృష్టకరం.
    లేకపోతే... ఈ గ్రహం సృష్టించిన వైవిధ్యాలను మీరు గమనిస్తే...
    రకరకాల జీవరాశులు... రకరకాల మనుషులు...
    ఇదంతా అద్భుతం... నమ్మశక్యం కానిది!
    దీని గురించి తెలుసుకోవాల్సిన విషయాలు చాలా ఉన్నాయి.
    
    ఇంకా... భారతదేశం ఉన్న అక్షాంశం, రేఖాంశం... ఇక్కడి వారిని ఎక్కువగా... బయట కన్నా అంతర్ముఖులుగా చేస్తుంది.
    మిగతావాళ్లు అలా కాలేరని కాదు.
    అందరూ చేయగలరు.
    కాలక్రమేణా సాంస్కృతిక పరిణామం కూడా జరుగుతుంది... ఇంకా చాలా అంశాలు ఉన్నాయి.
    కానీ కచ్చితంగా... ప్రపంచంలోని వివిధ ప్రాంతాల్లో ఉండటం వల్ల... శరీరం దానికి తగ్గట్టుగా తయారవుతుంది.
    
    అలాగని... మీరు ఒక చోట నుండి మరో చోటకి వెళితే... రెండేళ్లలో మీలో అంతా మారిపోతుందని కాదు... మారకపోవచ్చు... మీరు మారడానికి సిద్ధంగా ఉంటే తప్ప.
    మీరు దాన్ని అడ్డుకోవచ్చు... కానీ మీ అడ్డుగోడలు ఉన్నా సరే మార్పులు జరుగుతాయి... మీ జీవితకాలంలోనే!
    ఎందుకంటే భౌగోళికంగా... మీరు పూర్తిగా వేరే ప్రదేశంలో ఉన్నారు.
    
    దీన్ని లెక్కగట్టడం చాలా కష్టం... ఎందుకంటే సంస్కృతి, సామాజిక ప్రభావాలు చాలా ఎక్కువ... అవి ఎంతలా పెనవేసుకుపోయాయంటే... మీరు వాటిని విడదీయలేరు.
    కానీ ఒక్కసారి వెనక్కి తిరిగి చూస్తే... ఈ వలసలు మొదలవ్వకముందు... మనం ఇప్పుడు తిరుగుతున్నట్టు తిరగకముందు...
    ఈ గ్రహం... ఒక నిర్దిష్ట ప్రాంతంలో... ఒక రకమైన జీవాన్ని ఎలా సృష్టించిందో స్పష్టంగా చూడవచ్చు.
    ప్రతీ జీవానికి ఇది వర్తిస్తుంది... మనిషికి కూడా!
    
    మీరు... మధ్యలో ఆహారం గురించి ఏదో అడిగారు కదా.
    నేను మీకు ఇది చెప్పాలి.
    యోగలో... ఆహారం ఎలా తినాలన్నదానికి ఒక నియమం ఉంది...
    ఒక రోజులో మనిషి ఎంత దూరం నడవగలడో... ఆ దూరమే వ్యాసార్థం కావాలి... మీరు తినే ఆహారం ఆ పరిధి నుండే రావాలి.
    మీకు దూరంగా పండిన ఆహారాన్ని మీరు తినకూడదు. ఎందుకంటే... ఈ శరీరం... ప్రాథమికంగా... ఈ గ్రహంలో ఒక ముక్క.
    
    ఇది ఈ భూమిలో ఒక ముక్క అయినప్పుడు... మీరు అక్కడి ఆహారాన్ని తింటూ... ఆ ప్రాంతంలోనే నివసిస్తుంటే...
    మీ శరీరానికి, భూమికి మధ్య ఒక నిరంతర సంభాషణ జరుగుతూ ఉంటుంది...
    ఇది కేవలం మీరు చనిపోయాక... సమాధిలో ఉన్నప్పుడే జరుగుతుందని అనుకోకండి.
    ఈ రోజు కూడా... మీరు ఇక్కడ కూర్చున్నప్పుడు... మీరు ఈ ప్రదేశంలో కూర్చుంటే...
    మీ శరీరం... మీరు కూర్చున్న ఈ భూమి... చాలా గాఢమైన స్పందనలో ఉన్నాయి.
    
    అందువల్లనే... భూమితో స్పర్శలో ఉండటం... మనిషి ఆరోగ్యానికి చాలా ముఖ్యం.
    యోగ సెంటర్లో... ఎవరికైనా ఆరోగ్యం బాగోలేకపోతే... మేం వాళ్ళని తోటలో పని చేయమంటాం... వాళ్లు భూమి స్పర్శలో ఉంటారని.
    భూమి స్పర్శలో ఉండటమనేది... ఈ రోజు మోడ్రన్ స్పా(Spa)ల్లో 'మట్టి స్నానం' కింద మారిపోయింది.
    సరే... ఎలాగోలా... మీరు భూమి స్పర్శలో ఉండాలి.
    మట్టి స్నానంతోనా, తోటపనితోనా... అన్నది ముఖ్యం కాదు...
    నేల మీద పడుకున్నా సరే... ప్రాథమికంగా మీరు ఆ స్పర్శని కోరుకుంటున్నారు.
    
    ఆహారం అనేది ఒక లావాదేవీ.
    భూమిలో ఉన్నదాన్ని... మీరు శరీరంలోకి తీసుకుంటున్నారు.
    మీరు నివసిస్తున్న ఆ భూమి ముక్క నుండి ఆహారం వస్తేనే... మీ శరీరం బాగా పనిచేస్తుంది.
    అందుకే సాధారణంగా నియమం ఏంటంటే... మీరు ఒక రోజులో ఎంత నడవగలరో... మీరు తినే ఆహారం ఆ పరిధిలో నుండే రావాలి.
    
    అంటే... మీ సొంత పొలంలో ఆహారాన్ని పండించుకుని తింటే...
    మీరు ఒక నెలలోనే చూస్తారు... మీరు ఒక భూమిపై నివసిస్తూ... సొంతగా పండించుకుని తింటే...
    ఒక నెలలోనే... మీ ఆరోగ్యంలో స్పష్టమైన... చాలా స్పష్టమైన మార్పుని గమనిస్తారు.
    
    నేనంటాను… ఈ ఒక్క చిన్న పని చేస్తే...
    ఈ గ్రహం మీద క్యాన్సర్ ని... మనం 50 నుండి 60 శాతం తగ్గించవచ్చు.
    నేను దీనికి కట్టుబడి ఉన్నాను.
    వైద్య ప్రపంచం దీన్ని చూసి నవ్వుతుందని నాకు తెలుసు.
    కానీ నేను దీనికి 100% కట్టుబడి ఉన్నాను…
    క్యాన్సర్ ని కనీసం 50 శాతం తగ్గించవచ్చు... మనం నివసిస్తున్న భూమితో స్పర్శలో ఉంటూ... స్థానికంగా పండిన ఆహారాన్ని తింటే! మరెక్కడి నుంచో కాదు.
    
    ఇప్పుడు... నేను ఈ హోటల్లో టిఫిన్ కి వెళితే... బహుశా పండు న్యూజిలాండ్ నుండి వచ్చి ఉంటుంది.
    చేప వియత్నాం నుండి వస్తుందని చెప్పారు.
    ఇంకా మిగతావి ఎక్కడి నుండి వస్తాయో తెలీదు.
    రవాణా సౌకర్యం ఉంది కదా అని... ప్రపంచాన్ని అమ్మే సూపర్ మార్కెట్లు ఉన్నాయి కదా అని... మనం ఇది చేస్తున్నాం...
    ఇదంతా ఆనందం కోసమే... ఆరోగ్యం కోసం కాదు.
    < The above is an example script for you to understand how a sample script is optimized. this in not the target script that needs to be optimized.> 
    
    Now I want you to optimize the translation you made from the audio provided at the beginning. 
    Note: After you optimize the script according to above guidelines, just give the optimized Telugu script. No need to give any additional information.
    
    </script>
  <script type="text/plain" id="prompt_paragraphs">Now one more step to perform on the Telugu translation.


    The translation has been so good. Now in this step, do not redo or retouch the translation. All we have to do now is to convert this line by line type script into a paragraph by paragraph script.
    
    Sadhguru does not speak in grammatically complete sentences.
    He speaks in:
    thought units
    idea chunks
    pause-driven fragments
    
    Remember that we have used ! to indicate the unnatural ending as per the sadhguru style.
    and … to indicate the pauses between the fragments.
     
    Let me explain the target with an analogy.
    Let's take a human body.
    It is made of various body parts like - face, hands, torso, legs
    and now each body part is made of various subparts. Example: face has eyes, nose, mouth, ears.
    And each sub part has various internal parts. Example: eye has eyeball, eyelids.
    And each internal part has building parts. Example: eyeball has white eyeball and black eyeball.
    
    Now using this analogy, I want to punctuate the script.
    
    Each paragraph block is one body part - like face, head, torso, legs, etc
    Each complete point within a paragraph is like a subpart within a body part - like eye, hands, etc
    Each thought unit that makes up the point within the idea is like an internal part within a subpart.
    Each fragment that makes up the idea chunk is like a building part.
    
    Now I want to indicate this mapping using paragraphs, semicolons, and hyphens.
    
    we connect building parts with … to make up the internal part.
    we connect the internal parts with - to make up the subpart.
    we connect the subparts with ; to make up the body part.
    
    for example, the script should be punctuated like this:
    
    building part …  building part (one internal part)- another internal part - one more internal part; internal part - building part …  building part (another internal part); 
    
    
     internal part -  building part …  building part (one internal part)
    
    
    subpart; subpart; internal part - internal part; building part…building part…building part; subpart
    
    
    
    let me give another analogy also.
    Lets say what we want to convey is a picture.
    And how sadhguru conveys is,
    
    puzzle pieces of ‘Color A’ when joined will picturize the eyeball. Here the puzzle pieces can be taken as the white and the black eyeballs. these are joined with …
    Similarly puzzle pieces of ‘Color B’  when combined will form the eye lid. Here the pieces can be taken as the skin of the eyelid and the hair of the eyelid.  these are joined with …
    Now the ‘Color A’ set   and the ‘Color B’ set are joined by using hyphen. 
    thus it picturizes one part of the face (which is one para here). Similarly lets say the nose is made. Now we join the eye and the nose with semicolon. and again join the ear to these using a semicolon. Thus the face is completed (which is one paragraph here)
    
    Similarly we will construct the remaining parts in paragraphs, thus making up to the body.
    
    
    Below are the additional scenarios to consider:
    
       Use a dash ( - ):
        To Set Off Parenthetical Information:
        Example: This is a very important point - one that you shouldn't forget.
        Example: The students - all 35 of them - were excited for the field trip.
    
        To Introduce a List:
        Example: She bought many things - clothes, shoes, and accessories.
    
       To Introduce an additional Explanation after completion of one thought:
        Example: The reason for the delay - traffic congestion - was unavoidable.
        Example: He is my uncle - who is a 7 feet tall man.
        Example: Today is Sunday - which is a holiday.
    
        To Indicate an Abrupt Break or Change in Thought:
        Example: I was about to leave - wait, there's someone at the door.
     
       To Emphasize a Word or Phrase:
        Example: The most important thing - and I can't stress this enough - is to be yourself.
    
    Another situation:
    When a phrase completes, clarifies, or defines a key concept or item mentioned immediately before it,
    replace the punctuation before that phrase with a hyphen ( - ).
    
    Use this specifically when:
    
    The phrase reveals the actual components of a previously stated category
    (e.g., “two things — your body and your mind”)
    
    Here, the tone must land and conclude the meaning, not continue a list; The phrase is not a new point but the completion of the same point.
    
    
    
       Use a semi colon ( ; ):
    Between similar kinds of sentences use semi colon instead of a full stop. 
    
    Example:
    If you say Dhyanalingam, they'll say Dhyanaling;  If you say Shiva, they'll say Shiv; If you say Rama, they'll say Ram.
    
    
    Between sentences that are the part of one idea then use semi-colons between them instead of a fullstop.These are full complete sentences, not simply clauses.
    Example: 
    I love to read; books transport me to different worlds; But they are not readily available here. 
    
       Use an exclamation ( ! ):
    
    To mark the ending of half sentences which is okay in spoken telugu and make sense with proper modulation. These are not grammatically correct endings, but in spoken language they convey the correct meaning with sharp ending in modulation.
    
    Example:
    మీ చుట్టూ ఉన్న ప్రతీదానిపై సంపూర్ణ శ్రద్ధతో ఉంటే, అప్పుడు తెలుస్తుంది, ఇక్కడ జరుగుతున్నది ఒక మామూలు విషయం కాదని! జీవపరంగా! 
    
       Use an eclipse ( … ):
    to represent the pauses. These are already marked in the sense unit lines. Preserve them in the result, except the ones that occur at the end of the sense unit lines.the ones that occur at the end can be replaced with , ; - ? as per the context of the talk at that point of time and as per the above mentioned rules.
    
    Example:
    Sense unit line 1 of a thought: ఒకరు తమలో తాము... సరిగ్గా వ్యవస్థీకృతంగా లేకపోతే...
    Sense unit line 2 of a thought: అప్పుడు ఒంటరిగా ఉండటం చాలా కష్టం.
    
    Thought made into one sentence: ఒకరు తమలో తాము... సరిగ్గా వ్యవస్థీకృతంగా లేకపోతే, అప్పుడు ఒంటరిగా ఉండటం చాలా కష్టం.
    Description:
    here the … that happens in the middle of the sense line is preserved and the one that occurs at the end of the first line is changed to , This is because, at the end of the sense until line anyway a natural pause occurs. 
    
    Below i am giving some example sentences where i have used this way.
     మన తల్లుల గర్భకోశాలు... ప్రపంచంలోని స్త్రీలందరూ కూడా ... మన తల్లులు, 28 రోజుల చక్రాల గుండా వెళ్తారు - ఆరోగ్యంగా ఉంటే!

    Note: After you punctuate the script according to above guidelines, just give the optimized Telugu script. (Optimize the english also into paragraphs as per above rules, but in result only give the telugu, no need to give english. )No need to give any additional information.

    important notes: 
    
    Sadhguru does not speak in grammatically complete sentences.
    He speaks in:
    thought units
    idea chunks
    pause-driven fragments
    
    Here paragraph splitting, semicolons (;) and hyphens (-) and eclipses (…) are used to hint modulation cues to dubbing artists - not for grammar purposes. Please preserve them as it is, don't change them. Maintaining the same paragraph structure, and same punctuations. do not retouch those optimized areas. just focus on the below areas only. 
    
    Contextual word.
    
    In the English language, each word covers a broad spectrum and multiple contexts. But when it come to telugu, with in the same spectrum that is covered by the english word there are multiple specific telugu words each one covering a specific part of the spectrum, and similarly in telugu there will be specific words for each context that is covered by a single word in English.
    
    While translating, the focus might be on the broader aspects of structure, essence, etc. But now I want you to focus at the detailed level and identify the places where the generic telugu  words are used instead of the spectrum or contextually relevant specific telugu words. And replace that generic telugu word with the specific contextual word that conveys the speaker's intention when he said this english word - in the context of this talk. 
    
    Example 1:
    
    English sentence:
    This is what we are trying to demonstrate in Isha… that thousands of people… simply working like fanatics… from outside, they look like that. But, they're at ease; they close their eyes... okay, world doesn't exist.
    
    Original Telugu sentence:

    Improved telugu Sentence:
    ఈశాలో మేము <Context>ఆచరణలో చూపాలనుకుంటున్నది</Context> ఇదే… వేలాది మంది ప్రజలు…<Context> ఆవేశపరుల్లా </Context> పనిచేస్తుంటారు… బయటి నుండి చూస్తే, అలా కనిపిస్తారు. కానీ, వాళ్ళు<Context> నిశ్చింతగా </Context>ఉంటారు; కళ్ళు మూసుకుంటే... ఇక, ఈ ప్రపంచం <Context>ఉండదు</Context>.

    Which is  <Context>better </Context>? What you want happened, is that better? Whatever happens, you're fine, that is that better? That's all. 
    
    
    Original Telugu sentence:
    ఏది  <Context>మంచిది </Context>? మీరు కోరుకున్నది జరగడం, అది మంచిదా? ఏది జరిగినా, మీరు బాగానే  <Context>ఉండటం </Context>, అది మంచిదా? అంతే. 
    Improved telugu Sentence:
    ఏది  <Context>శ్రేయస్కరమైనది? </Context> - మీరు కోరుకున్నది జరగడం, అది శ్రేయస్కరమా? లేక ఏది జరిగినా, మీరు బాగానే  <Context>ఉంటారు </Context>, అది శ్రేయస్కరమా? 
    
    Example 3:
    
    English sentence:
    If you're seeking fulfillment of life… then… it needs involvement. Devotion means… just unquestioned, <Context>unbridled</Context> involvement, that's all 
    
    Original Telugu sentence:
    ఒకవేళ మీరు జీవితంలో పరిపూర్ణత కోసం వెతుకుతుంటే… దానికి నిమగ్నత కావాలి. భక్తి అంటే… కేవలం ప్రశ్నించని, <Context>అదుపులేని</Context> నిమగ్నత, అంతే
    
    Improved telugu Sentence:
    ఒకవేళ మీరు జీవితంలో పరిపూర్ణత కోరుతుంటే … దానికి నిమగ్నత అవసరం. భక్తి అంటే… ప్రశ్నించని, <Context>అడ్డుకట్టలేని</Context> నిమగ్నత
    
    
    
    
    Example 4:
    English sentence:
    The reason why in this country… you know, marriages have been very stable, not always because two people are getting along great, not always; Because when they got married… a few thousand people got married along with them; Bride and the groom were a small aspect of the marriage; 
    
    There were so many other people <Context> involved</Context>; Now if you have to break it, you have to break it on all levels; you can't break it.

    Example 5:
    English sentence:
    But once you become human... now, either you evolve <Context>consciously</Context> or you stagnate; that's all the choice you have. 
    
    
    Original Telugu sentence:
    కానీ ఒకసారి మీరు మనిషి అయ్యాక... ఇప్పుడు, మీరు <Context>స్పృహతో</Context> పరిణామం చెందాలి లేదా అక్కడే నిలిచిపోవాలి; మీకు ఉన్న అవకాశం అంతే.

    Example 6:
    English sentence:
    What is human is a flux; you can be anything you want - and this is the human being's struggle. Right now human beings are not suffering their bondage... they are suffering their freedom.
    
    Original Telugu sentence:
     మానవమనేది <Context>ఒక ప్రవాహం</Context>; మీరు ఏమవ్వాలనుకుంటే అది కాగలరు - ఇదే మానవుని సంఘర్షణ. ప్రస్తుతం మానవులు తమ బంధనాల వల్ల బాధపడటం లేదు... వాళ్ళు తమ స్వేచ్ఛ వల్లే బాధపడుతున్నారు.
    
    Improved telugu Sentence:
     ‘మనిషి’ అనేది ఒక <Context>నిరంతర చలనం</Context>; మీరు ఏమవ్వాలనుకుంటే అది కాగలరు - ఇదే మానవుని తపన. ప్రస్తుతం మానవులు తమ బంధనాల వల్ల బాధపడటం లేదు... వాళ్ళు తమ స్వేచ్ఛ వల్ల బాధపడుతున్నారు.
    
    
    Example 7:
    English sentence:
    If your life also was fixed as the animal life is fixed - “this is how you will be”..  you wouldn't be <Context>struggling</Context> so much; you wouldn't be experiencing as much pain and misery that human beings are experiencing right now, isn't it?

    Original Telugu sentence:

    Example 10:
    English sentence:
    Intelligence can become a very negative thing, if it does not  <Context>translate <Context> into some level of competence; 
    
    Original Telugu sentence:

    Intention:
    
    
    Based on the context in which this sentence is occurring, and based on the picture that is being created before and after this sentence, identify the intention of the speaker. what he actually is trying to convey. Rather than just relying on the words and doing the word to word translation, grasp the intention based on the context and express it directly in telugu in a colloquial way. No need to follow the exact word to word based translation. The intention needs to be expressed here.
    
    
    
    Below i am giving some Examples of identifying the intention:
    Example 1
    
    
    English:
     love is not profitable.
     It’s a… a very conscious, <Intention>loss making venture</Intention>; 
    
    Telugu:
    ప్రేమ లాభ పడేందుకు కాదు
    అది స్పృహతో, <Intention>నష్ట పోయేందుకు చేసే ప్రయత్నం</Intention>
    
    Optimized:
    ప్రేమ లాభసాటి కాదు
    అది - <Intention>నష్టం తెచ్చేదని తెలిసి కూడా</Intention> కోరునే విషయం
    
    Description:
    Here the effort is not to make a loss. 
    He is saying its nature is ‘loss making’, and still we choose it consciously.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Example 2
    
    
    English:
    30 times the idiot shoots at you and misses you; I am so glad; I hope <Intention>they </Intention>keep missing like that.

    Optimized:
    <Intention>వాళ్ళలానే </Intention>గురి తప్పాలని కోరుకుంటున్నాను.
    
    Description:
    Here sadhguru is not speaking about that single person who missed.
    He is speaking about the enemies  in general. So we made it into  plural 
    
    
    
    
    Example 3
    
    
    English:
    Yes sir, because uh… he is always wide open and waiting; it's the people who are <Intention>far away, in their own world.</Intention>
    
    
    Telugu:
    ఉన్నాయండి, కానీ, ఆయనెప్పుడూ చేతులు చాపి, ఎదురుచూస్తూనే ఉన్నాడు; మనుషులే <Intention>చాలా దూరంగా, తమ లోకంలో ఉన్నారు.</Intention>
    
    Optimized:
    ఉన్నాయండి! 
    ఎందుకంటే ..  ఆయనెప్పుడూ చేతులు చాపి, ఎదురుచూస్తూనే ఉన్నాడు; మనుషులే <Intention>చాలా దూరంగా ఉన్నారు … తమ సొంత లోకంలో!</Intention>
    
    Description:
    Here we just made it into two clauses. As it is expressed as two details in English. 
    
    
    
    
    Example 4
    
    
    English:
    "I do my Om Namo Shivaya jap <Intention>and everything</Intention>,
    
    Telugu:
     ఓం నమః శివాయ’’ <Intention>జపం లాంటివన్నీ</Intention> చేస్తాను
    
    Optimized:
     ఓం నమః శివాయ’’ <Intention>జపం మొదలైనవన్నీ</Intention> చేస్తాను
    
    Description:
    Here he is not saying that he is doing things that are alike to jap 
    He is saying he is doing jap and things like that.
    
    
    
    
    Example 5
    
    
    English:
    You take some fenugreek, boil it, and the decoction that comes out of it, you mix honey with it and you can drink it. Lot of people drink it like coffee, but you need special kind of <Intention>taste buds</Intention> or you need tremendous acceptance. 
    
    Telugu:
    మెంతులు ... మరిగించి... వడకట్టి... తేనె కలుపుకుని తాగొచ్చు; 
    చాలామంది దాన్ని కాఫీ లాగా తాగుతారు, కానీ దానికి ఓ ప్రత్యేకమైన <Intention>నాలుక </Intention>ఉండాలి, లేదా చాలా సహనం ఉండాలి. 
    
    
    Optimized:
    అలా తాగడాలంటే ఓ ప్రత్యేకమైన <Intention>అభిరుచి </Intention>ఉండాలి
    
    Description:
    Here he is not talking about the tongue literally, he is speaking about their preference and patience to take such coffee.
    
    
    
    
    Example 6
    
    
    English:
     She said, "I hear that monks are looking for shelter in many homes; <Intention>why don't you come and stay in my house</Intention>?"
    
    Telugu:
    ఆమె, "సన్యాసులు చాలా ఇళ్ళలో ఆశ్రయం కోసం చూస్తున్నారని విన్నాను; <Intention>నువ్వెందుకు నా ఇంట్లో ఉండకూడదు</Intention>?" అంది. 
    
    Optimized:
    ఆమె, "సన్యాసులు చాలా ఇళ్ళలో ఆశ్రయం కోసం చూస్తున్నారని విన్నాను; నువ్వు  <Intention>వచ్చి నా ఇంట్లో ఉండొచ్చు కదా?</Intention>" అంది. 
    
    Description:
    Here the translation was literal, like grammar based. 
    But in telugu the intention is conveyed differently, not in the same grammar syntax to syntax translation.
    
    
    
    
    Example 7
    
    
    English:
    Right now in the world, a whole lot of people think <Intention>only in misery you can be profound</Intention>;
    
    Telugu:
    ప్రస్తుతం ప్రపంచంలో, చాలా మంది - <Intention>బాధను మాత్రమే తీవ్రంగా అనుభవించగలమని అనుకుంటారు</Intention>;
    
    Optimized:
    ప్రస్తుతం ప్రపంచంలో, చాలా మంది - <Intention>కేవలం బాధలో మాత్రమే ప్రగాఢత అనుభూతి చెందగలమనుకుంటారు;</Intention>
    
    Description:
    Here he is not talking about experiencing the pain profoundly. 
    He is saying about how we will go to profound intensity when it comes to pain.
    
    
    
    
    Example 8
    
    
    English:
    <Intention>Because</Intention> there is not much possibility, there is not much misery either.
    
    Telugu:
    <Intention>ఎందుకంటే </Intention>అక్కడ పెద్దగా అవకాశాలు లేవు కాబట్టి; అంత బాధ కూడా ఉండదు.
    
    Optimized:
    సంభావ్యతలు పెద్దగా లేవు <Intention>కాబట్టి</Intention>, బాధ కూడా అంతగా ఉండదు.
    
    Description:
    Here he is conveying the point in cause and effect format. First he is telling the cause and then he is telling the effect.
    So the because at the beginning here indicates that this is the cause. Not to literally place <Intention>ఎందుకంటే </Intention>at the begining in the telugu also.
    
    
    
    
    Example 9
    
    
    English:
    You don't see other creatures of the planet suffering like human beings. Their suffering is purely physical. If they're physically harmed, <Intention>they are in pain. </Intention>
    
    Even in pain, they do not know the kind of suffering that a human being knows.
    
    
    
    Telugu:
    ఈ భూమి మీద ఉన్న ఇతర జీవులు మనుషుల్లా బాధపడటం మీరు చూడరు. వాటి బాధ కేవలం శారీరకమైనది. వాటికి శారీరకంగా హాని జరిగితే, <Intention>అవి బాధ పడతాయి. </Intention>
    
    బాధ ఉన్నా కూడా, ఒక మనిషికి తెలిసినంత బాధ వాటికి తెలీదు.
    
    
    
    
    Optimized:
    ఈ భూమ్మీది ఇతర జీవులు మనుషులంతగా బాధపడటం మీరు చూడరు. వాటి బాధ కేవలం శారీరకమైనది. వాటికి శారీరకంగా హాని జరిగితే, <Intention>నొప్పికి గురవుతాయి.</Intention>
    
    నొప్పి విషయంలో కూడా, మనిషికి తెలిసినంతటి బాధ వాటికి తెలీదు.  
    
    
    Description:
    Here pain and suffering are different and he is using the word pain when he is referring to the physical pain. That is not caught in the translation. So we replaced బాధ పడతాయి with  నొప్పికి గురవుతాయి.
    
    
    
    
    Example 10
    
    
    English:
    Human being knows this suffering<Intention> not because creation gave this suffering to you</Intention>; creation just gave you the freedom... to make whatever you wish to out of yourself.
    
    Telugu:
    మనిషికి బాధ ఉంది - <Intention>కానీ దాన్ని మీకు ఇచ్చింది సృష్టి కాదు</Intention>; సృష్టి కేవలం మీకు స్వేచ్ఛ నిచ్చింది... మిమ్మల్ని మీరు ఎలా కావాలంటే అలా మలుచుకోవడానికి. 
    
    Optimized:
    మనిషికి ఇంతటి బాధ తెలియడానికి కారణం - <Intention>సృష్టి ఆ బాధను మీకు ఇవ్వడం వల్ల కాదు</Intention> - సృష్టి మీకు స్వేచ్ఛని ఇచ్చింది - మిమ్మల్ని, మీకు ఎలా కావాలంటే అలా చేసుకునే స్వేచ్ఛనిచ్చింది! 
    
    Description:
    Here he is not talking about whether it was given by creation or not. By using the phrase  ‘not because’ he is telling that it was not the cause.
    
    
    
    Example 11
    
    
    English:
    we do the same things what the other animals do; It is just that all that the animal can do; we do the same things but we can do it consciously -<Intention> that's a big difference.</Intention>
    
    Telugu:
    జంతువులు చేసే పనులే మనం కూడా చేస్తాం; కాకపోతే ఏంటంటే, జంతువు చేయగలిగినదంతా మనం కూడా చేస్తాం -  కానీ దాన్ని మనం స్పృహతో చేయగలం - <Intention>అదే మనకి వాటికీ ఉన్న పెద్ద తేడా.</Intention>
    
    
    
    Optimized:
    <Intention>అది చాలా పెద్ద తేడా!</Intention>
    
    
    Description:
    Here he is not talking about whether it is the big difference or not.
    He is talking about how big a difference it is.
    
    
    
    Example 12
    
    
    English:
    <Intention>This is also a way, for me to demonstrate to people</Intention>; whatever life throws at us, it's not in our hands; what we make out of it is 100% in our hands. 
    
    
    Telugu:
    <Intention>ప్రజలకు చూపించడానికి ఇది కూడా ఒక మార్గం;</Intention> జీవితం మనపై ఏది వేస్తారనేది, అది మన చేతుల్లో లేదు; దాన్ని మనం ఎలా మలచుకుంటామనేది 100% మన చేతుల్లోనే ఉంటుంది.
    
    
    
    Optimized:
    <Intention>ఇది ప్రజలకు ఆచరణాత్మకంగా చూపించేందుకు ఒక మార్గం కూడా</Intention>; అదేంటంటే - జీవితం మనపై ఏం విసురుతుందనేది మన చేతుల్లో ఉండదు; అయితే దాన్ని మనం ఎలా మలచుకుంటామనేది 100% మన చేతుల్లోనే ఉంటుంది.
    
    
    
    Description:
    Here he is not telling that this is also a one more way to demonstrate to people.
    He is telling that, apart from other purposes that it serves, it also acts a way to demonstrate to people.
    
    
    
    Example 13
    
    
    English:
    That is true; that is true. Uh, yeah, yeah, <Intention>you can never be cautious enough</Intention>, but I think, uh, you've just proven that if you keep your head about you, uh, all the time this is possible.
    
    Telugu:
    అది నిజం; అది నిజం. ఆఁ, అవునవును, <Intention>మనం ఎప్పటికీ తగినంత జాగ్రత్తగా ఉండలేం</Intention>, కానీ,  మీ బుర్ర మీ దగ్గరే పెట్టుకుంటే,  అన్ని వేళలా ఇది సాధ్యమేనని మీరు నిరూపించారనుకుంటున్నాను.
    
    Optimized:
    అది నిజం; అది నిజం. ఆఁ, అవునవును, <Intention>ఎంత శ్రద్ధ పెట్టినా అది సరిపోదు</Intention>; కానీ మీరిది నిరూపించారనుకుంటున్నాను - అప్రమత్తతో ఉంటే,  అన్ని వేళలా ఇది సాధ్యమేనని!
    
    Description:
    It is translated literally. 
    It is about whether we can be cautious or not. His intention is that we have to be very cautious as much as possible.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Example 14
    
    
    English:
    because, uh, <Intention>the altitude was not like this</Intention>, but, uh, the weather, was even worse than this actually, in many ways. 
    
    
    Telugu:
    ఎందుకంటే - <Intention>అక్కడ ఎత్తు ఇలా లేదు</Intention>; కానీ, వాతావరణం మాత్రం, నిజానికి చాలా విధాలుగా దీనికంటే దారుణంగా ఉంది.
    
    Optimized:
    ఎందుకంటే -<Intention> అది ఇంత ఎత్తైన ప్రదేశం కాదు</Intention> - కానీ, వాతావరణం మాత్రం, నిజానికి చాలా విధాలుగా దీనికంటే దారుణంగా ఉంది.
    
    
    Description:
    Here the translation is literal.
    While he used altitude as a subject here, in reality he was comparing the height of the place. So we wrote the actual intention instead of just literal translation.
    
    
    
    Example 15
    
    
    English:
    <Intention>Such a</Intention> lovely idea Guruji.
    
    Telugu:
    <Intention>అలాంటి </Intention>ఒక చక్కని ఆలోచన గురూజీ
    
    Optimized:
    <Intention>భలే </Intention>చక్కని ఆలోచన గురూజీ
    
    Description:
    Here the translation is literal. To convey the actual intention, literal word to word translation wont do justice. So first I grasped the intention, then I directly expressed that intention in Telugu - without referring to the words used in English.
    
    
    
    
    
    Example 16
    
    
    English:
    Everything that we are right now - every breath that we take, every experience that we go through is <Intention>only valuable, because</Intention> we are on a limited lease of time;
    
    Telugu:
    మనమిప్పుడున్న ప్రతిదీ - మనం తీసుకునే ప్రతి శ్వాస, మనం పొందే ప్రతి అనుభవం కేవలం<Intention> విలువైనదే, ఎందుకంటే </Intention>మనం పరిమిత కాలపు గడువుపై ఉన్నాం;
    
    
    Optimized:
    ప్రస్తుతం మనకు సంబంధించిన ప్రతిదీ - తీసుకునే ప్రతీ శ్వాసా,  పొందే ప్రతీ అనుభవం <Intention>విలువైనవి కావడానికి కారణం - మన సమయం పరిమితం కాబట్టే! </Intention>
    
    Description:
     Here by using the combination of words, only and because, he is establishing a cause and effect. So we have optimised the translation also into a cause and effect format.
    
    
    
    Bringing the verb part to the end of the sentence while quoting someones words or while expressing internal thought process.
    
    Example:
    
    Original : వాళ్ళు <T3> అనుకుంటున్నారు<T3> ఇప్పుడు ఆధ్యాత్మికత అంటే మీరు హిమాలయాలకు వెళ్ళాలి లేదా కాశీకి వెళ్ళాలి... లేదా మీరు అన్నీ వదిలేయాలి అని
    
    optimized : వాళ్ళు “ఇప్పుడు ఆధ్యాత్మికత అంటే మీరు హిమాలయాలకు వెళ్ళాలి లేదా కాశీకి వెళ్ళాలి... లేదా మీరు అన్నీ వదిలేయాలి” అని <T3>అనుకుంటున్నారు<T3> 
    
    description:
    Here the structure is subject then comma then the thought or the words spoken by the subject in quotes then the verb that conveys saying or thinking and then period or question mark or other punctuation as per the need. Remember the … and - and ; within the quoted portion are still preserved.
    
    
    Example:
    Original 
    ప్రతీ ఒక్కరూ <T3> అడుగుతున్నారు<T3> , "సద్గురు మీరెందుకు దీనిపై మీ తల బద్దలు కొట్టుకుంటున్నారు?"

    Here the structure is subject then comma then the thought or the words spoken by the subject in quotes then the verb that conveys saying or thinking and then period or question mark or other punctuation as per the need. Remember the … and - and ; within the quoted portion are still preserved.
    
    
    Example:
    Original 
    <T3>నేనన్నాను<T3>, వాళ్ళకి తాగడానికి నీళ్ళు లేకపోతే... వాళ్ళని ధ్యానం చేయమని నేను ఎలా చెప్పగలను?
    
    
    Optimized:

    description:
    Here the subject who spoke and the verb that conveys the speaking are in one word. we have separated them, and placed the subject before the quoted part and the verb after the quoted part.
    
    
    Original:
    ప్రజలు నన్ను <T3>అడుగుతూనే ఉంటారు<T3>, "సద్గురు, ఈ దేశంలో ఆధ్యాత్మిక ప్రక్రియను పునరుద్ధరించడానికి మార్గం ఏమిటి?"
    
    Optimized:
    ప్రజలు నన్ను <T3>ఇలా<T3> అడుగుతూనే ఉంటారు, "సద్గురు, ఈ దేశంలో ఆధ్యాత్మిక ప్రక్రియను పునరుద్ధరించడానికి మార్గం ఏమిటి?" <T3>అంటారు.<T3>
    
     description:
    Here the subject part is long, bringing the whole long phrase to the end may make sync loss while dubbing. So what we did is, we added the verb that conveys asking again at the end to make it end in a natural way of spoken Telugu. also not the i have added the word ఇలా as a as a cataphoric adverb / discourse-bridging adverb.
